i'm copying [ed's idea](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/18-02-2023-The-Legend-of-0-point-38mm) ;-)

## pentel techniclick 0.5

this is not a pen, it's a mechanical pencil. but it was my old reliable for a very long time now. and it's a solid pencil (9/10). it works well and it's got a funny push mechanism. a good amount of pencil lead will leave you writing for months[^1]. the only criticism i have is that it is kind of easy to press the button, but that's only a little thing. also be careful with the clipping thing, because it's really easy to break. some of my friends[^2] also used to use this and all of their clipping things broke as well.

## bic cristal

literally everyone knows this pen. not much to say. cheap, writes everywhere, but it's a ballpoint pen, and it hurts to write with. 

20/20[^3]-5 because hand hurt ;-(.

## m&g en-gel k-35

i got this as a gift. much different to bic cristal, this is a gel pen. and so it writes well, and is fluid. sometimes it doesn't write, but that's okay. apart from that, not too much to add tbh. it also has a very satisfying click sound :-).

solid 37/35 (-0.2 for not writing sometimes).

[^1]: probably, i didn't test this.
[^2]: h bird specifically
[^3]: 20c is the cost, so that's the thing i am using
