I am one to mess with his computer a lot. As a result, I also end up completely destroying my computer a lot and having to restart. Since most of my work is on my computer, I need a way to redo everything as fast as possible. Of course, I'm presuming that you also may need to do this.

Of course, as these tutorials are mainly for me, they will fit my own 'things', such as how I assume you are using a Debian-based Linux distro and the likes.
