    <p>â€¦ i am scared. all of the questions were worth so little. this is psychological warfare. do i write lots and the marks are very heavy? or do i write little because only a little bit. i am quite afraid.</p>

<p>i am worried about this assessment task. the in-class seemed a little <em>too</em> easy. and this puts me off, especially when everyone is still writing. i might be screwed. i might be screwed. i might be screwed. this is not good. please for the love of god, please be loosely marked. i might be ducked otherwise.</p>
