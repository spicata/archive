ah, the age old debate. which is **better: paper or computers**. paper can be used any way you want. it's much easier to draw diagrams, and you can do things such as folding and [cover n check](coverCheck). it also practices writing. on the other hand, computers are faster for writing notes. notes here can be duplicated and are perfectly legible.

*proposal*: **use both**. that might work. how would you use both? dunno. **find a way**.
