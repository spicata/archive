    <p>dear companies.</p>

<p>you can make wonderful apps, im sure. however, it seems you guys have <strong>no personality whatsoever</strong>. first of all, when i go onto your websites, i don’t want to see a <strong>hella generic, unoriginal, minimalist home page</strong>, where i have to scroll for 300 metres to get around 12 lines of information about your product. secondly, i want to feel like i am actually <strong>talking to a person</strong>, not some massive corporate entity. it makes me feel like you don’t actually care about me, the user, and instead it just feels like you are just trying to make a profit. it feels you are using me, not trying to give me a useful thing.</p>

<p>benefits to you? well, us consumers will trust you more, and also <a href="sentimentalValue">sentimental value</a>.</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: be human. (don’t do a zuckerburg)</p>
