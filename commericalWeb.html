    <p><strong>the web is more commerical</strong> and i don’t mean from a “buy this” point of view. i mean from a <strong>“everything applies to business”</strong> point of view. when i search up what the hell “Re:” actually means in an email, i <strong>don’t want to see</strong> blog posts about how putting “Re:” actually decreases <strong>click-through rate</strong>. i want to know what it means, and if regular, living, breathing people use it.</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: how do you fix this? i’ve got no clue.</p>
