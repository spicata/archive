  <p>To foster a community of individuals who individually own a online medium for the distribution of notes. The goal is to exist independently from external entities and help each other cultivate their own notes.<br />

<p>The Town is a website community. We all make websites in order to be in a part of the Town, because that is the base requirement. We share tips on how to fix and make our websites, our questions are technical difficulties, and our time is spent to making our website look good. Our questions to new members are ‘Have you made a website.’ This it the Town, and this is good.</p>

<p>Except, is it? Is this how the Town is intended to function, because we seem to be missing to be a critical part of the Town’s original ideas. The Town is a <em>notes</em> website community, and we seem to be missing the notes.</p>

<p>The last time Athu’s Diagonally was updated was May 24th. For Jole’s Siberian Cookie Gulag, May 17th. Before we pestered Anonymous, his last update was May 9th.</p>

<p>The problem runs deeper than the last update. Jole’s Siberian Cookie Gulag has 1 note on his website. Athu’s website is under-baked, there are a lot of missing notes. Anonymous’s website is not much better, and neither is Choyu’s.</p>

<p>These are our most egregious offenders, but I believe that everyone does this to an extent, even I’m guilty. In the Town, having a website is priority #1. Having notes is a very distant second.</p>

<p>The Town needs to refocus its vision. And at this point, we might need a lens to do so.</p>
