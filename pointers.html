    <blockquote>
  <p>wisdom: the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgement<br />
knowledgeable: intelligent and well informed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give other people pointers, and not things to memorise. If you give them pointers, you make it a lot easier for them to learn on their own, which builds then their knowledge, but also their wisdom. If you just feed them, they will not accrue the same wisdom. Give them a guide, but not a map.</p>
