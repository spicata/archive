Hey you. You might be going around reading my articles, thinking things like: 

> "Wow this guy really doesn't know a thing about the world. I bet I could show him up."  
> \- stock person

If you do think something like that, then feel free to! Send me your ideas at [pixelandian@gmail.com](mailto:pixelandian@gmail.com) (or [spicata@99000000.xyz](mailto:spicata@99000000.xyz) if you want to be novel, it leads to the same inbox anyways). On the other hand, if you happen to have a website, like the other Town Members, then why not just upload your response onto your website? I want to see what you guys think, and I want to know where you think I am wrong. 

Think of it kind of like a digital and public pen-pal system I guess. I write articles, you send me articles in response.
