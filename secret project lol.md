the problem: i notice that the average quality of notes and the content that we produce is rather low. this is not a bad thing within itself, however, it does not really let the town actually produce stuff of value. it is great that we have a community, but we cannot grow a tree

the solution: well, it's clear to me that this will not be for everyone. after all, not everyone joined the town in order to share notes.

[i think that many people saw joining the town as a sort of trade now. you make public notes, and we add you to the town. the notes are not the goal, it is the price]: #

the idea is to make a smaller group within the Town (or maybe even beyond the group, if a person fails to join) that has stronger ideals/values on creating better notes. this would require someone to pass certain criteria to join the guild.

[just note that this is not a political party, but rather a 'guild' of improvement]: #

additionally, it would require someone to take on a 'student' so that they can teach them.

also, this idea will require people to actually check other people's notes in order to do some quality checks. give feedback, and add onto others.

[i guess this is kind of similar to how learning in the public works]: #

## the chain?

how about this. if someone makes a page, and you think it is good, add onto it. copy an extract that you want to add to onto your website, and write more about it. hopefully they see it, and then add it. creating bigger vaults of knowledge through collaboration, not competition.

## pillars of this group

- collaboration
- effort
- growth

collaboration is self-explanatory. this group should be working together to create a better thing, not competing with each other.
