we live in an increasingly connected world, and with that comes better communication, but this raises the question: **is all communication that is fast communication that is worth it**? i would beg to differ. and even if it is important, the rush of our communication leads to **half-thought out responses** and shallowness. so...

*proposal*: try to send **one email per person per day**. email, specifically because it is slower and you can't check if the other person has checked, so you are **forced to sit on your thoughts** for a while. and sending more than one is overkill. **don't treat email like messaging**.
