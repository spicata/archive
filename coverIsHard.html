    <p>the thing i proposed in <a href="coverCheck">cover n check</a> is <strong>harder than i thought</strong>. it’s because i don’t know how to do it. should you have <strong>more questions or longer answers</strong>? how often do you need questions?</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: i should experiment. you should too, maybe.</p>
