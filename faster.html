    <p>Along with the <a href="kanban">kanban board</a>, another thing that I think to get stuff done is a little thing I’ve realised… and it’s that if I work faster, I also get to play faster. In short, the faster I finish the things I really need to get done, the sooner I can put up my legs and relax, whether that be writing these ramblings, playing on the Town’s Minecraft server, drawing xob, etc.</p>

<p>This strategy does actually require you to take breaks and have fun though. It isn’t working faster so that I can do even more work faster. You just complete the same amount that you always complete in a shorter time. Once that’s done, stop. That’s the end of your day. Go do things to wind down. It’s good for you.</p>
