    <p>you know the saying <em>“think smarter not harder”</em>. well there’s something even better. get so good at something so that <strong>it becomes instinct</strong>, so you <strong>don’t think at all</strong>. take what pranav said (see <a href="quotes">unmotivational quotes</a>), and simply make it natural so you don’t think.</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: practice, practice, practice again, until something becomes second nature.</p>
