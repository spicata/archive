Along with the [kanban board](kanban), another thing that I think to get stuff done is a little thing I've realised... and it's that if I work faster, I also get to play faster. In short, the faster I finish the things I really need to get done, the sooner I can put up my legs and relax, whether that be writing these ramblings, playing on the Town's Minecraft server, drawing xob, etc.

This strategy does actually require you to take breaks and have fun though. It isn't working faster so that I can do even more work faster. You just complete the same amount that you always complete in a shorter time. Once that's done, stop. That's the end of your day. Go do things to wind down. It's good for you.
