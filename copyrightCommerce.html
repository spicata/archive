<p>Copyright does not exist to aid people who do things ‘for fun’. If you create things solely because it is fun, then you do not need to reserve all the rights to your work. Of course, you can if you want, but it is not necessary.</p>

<p>If you do make things simply because it is fun to make things, then the value of the object (to you) diminishes after you have made it. There is still the sentimental value and/or how much you enjoy it, however, none of these diminish even if others have it. So, why reserve all rights? If you made it for fun, surely it is better to let your creation run wild in the nature of content.</p>
