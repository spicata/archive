> Apprentice: a beginner, originates from Latin word *apprehendere*, meaning to learn.

The Town has a learning problem. People join the Town, and are advertised to use this tool, or this new template, and yet are not taught how to use them. So, they stumble around, which wastes both the learner's time and effort, and doesn't contribute to the Town. We need a better system to learn.

My suggestion is to have a teacher-apprentice system. If people have the time to do so, and the knowledge to effectively guide someone through the steps of making a website, they should take on a student, in order to lead them through these steps. On the other hand, if there is a member attempting to join the Town, let a teacher guide them through, and learn from them.

The point of the teacher-apprentice system is that so that the teachers can actually lead students through the Town, at least until they can get their bearing and can do it by themselves.

## The Contract

### For the Teacher

- Teach the student in an area that you are confident in
- Have patience
- Be willing to help them when they need help

Your new job is to help the student in understanding whatever there is to understand, so when time comes, you can let the go and they can figure stuff out on their own. However, no matter how good you are at teaching, give the students time to explore by themselves. Experience is a better teacher than you.

You will only have one student at a time. Focus on them, and don't fragment your focus between different students.

### For the Student

- Learn
- Put in effort
- Explore things on your own.

You new job is to learn from the teachers. However, don't rely too heavily on your mentor, and be ready to explore the jungle on your own too. Your teacher might be useful, but ultimately, experience is the best teacher. As long as you try, you'll learn.
