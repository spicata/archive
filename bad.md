i kind of feeling like my expectations for the website have gotten to big. not very good, as high expectation → more pressure → i make less things. and so, this will be the start of a very bad (not good) ramblings once again, just so that i can bring down the average 'goodness' of this website.

tldr: expect worse content from now on. it might get better *later*. and yes, season 2 has finally started.
