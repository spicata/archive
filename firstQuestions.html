    <p>if you want to change something, donate something, buy something, ask why the problem exists in the first place. to use an example i saw on the infinite net, before donating to save children in africa from an african child crusher, ask WHY THE HELL IS THERE AN AFRICAN CHILD CRUSHER IN AFRICA? itâ€™s pretty simple stuff. it might help you to find a better solution. for example, i wanted to get keyboard that i can pair to two devices so that i could easily change between them to lower time loss. i use the other computer only for discord. why do i have discord?</p>
