  <p>“Know the enemy and know yourself, and you need to fret the result of 100 battles” - Sun Tzu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s assume that you are trying to keep your feelings in check. That you want to ‘fight’ it, because otherwise, you’ll fall prey to fallacious thinking such as the affect heuristic and acting based on your impulses. However, how does one fight an enemy that is too vague and abstract for one to comprehend. Where should one start? You understand it. Understand what your feelings are right now, and you can work to fix it. Instead of having an intangible mess you need to clean, you will know where to start.</p>

<p>Think about your feelings, not so that you can ‘feel better’, but so that you know what enemy you have to face. Ignoring problems never fixes it.</p>
