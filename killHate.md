**hate is a bad, terrible thing**. it's also how a lot of us work. whether we hate this or hate that, **it's generally bad**. of course, sometimes hate is okay. for example, i hate when people kill other people, because... i think hating murder is normal human behaviour.

*proposal*: **stop hating things**. or well... treat them the same way you would treat other things. and if you hate everything... uh... try not to.
