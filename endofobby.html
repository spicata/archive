    <p>Welcome.</p>

<p>To the end of the obsidian journey for me… maybe.</p>

<p>Obsidian is a great app. I would recommend it for whoever takes notes. However, as I use it, and have gotten more and more familiar with Markdown, Jekyll, and YAML, I feel as if I have outgrown this app.</p>

<p>Of course, if you asked me if I would recommend Obsidian? Of course I would. It was truly a pleasure using it. But I feel that Obsidian lacks a kind of compatibility and flexability. It was great until it wasn’t. It functions as an ‘Obsidian’ app first, and a Markdown app second.</p>

<p>In hindsight, this was pretty obvious. It isn’t quite possible to create a beginner-friendly, user-friendly app while trying to capture everything. Obsidian excels as a beginner-friendly app. But in doing so, it kind of lacks the flexibility of Markdown.</p>

<p>It gives you power over your notes, yes. Enough power? Maybe not for me.</p>
