  <p>Lull: (noun) a temporary interval of quiet or lack of activity.</p>

<p>Although the Town was once small, it produced a surprising amount of things to read, such as Edward’s writings, my ramblings, and Shan-mei’s rants. However, recently, the amount of things to read — apart from notes (<a href="public">which I already have my complaints about</a>) — has seen quite a bit of a decline<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Even though the Town is bigger than ever, it also seems much more desolate.</p>

<p>I sort of mourn this lack of content, it was always much fun to read what everyone had to say. Now I’m just left to wonder, what happened to everyone’s original ideas? Have they no new comments or thoughts? Where is the once lively and personal Town I once knew?</p>

<p>And for you, the reader, depending on when you have joined, you may be lucky enough to still have their readings to read (and mine too), as so I’ll link it here: <a href="https://obsidiannotes-v-4.pages.dev/writings/">Edward’s writings</a>, <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/ranting.html">Shan-mei’s rants</a>, and of course you know where to find mine.</p>

<p>If you are a member of the Town, I urge you to make something similar to these things that were once prevalent in the Town. It does not need to be good, and it also doesn’t need to take too much time to make. You can just quickly put together a page about something on your mind if you really want. However little, it brings quite a bit of life and excitement to the Town, and with the number of people in the Town, could easily snowball into a stream of continuous things to read<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

      <p>Felt as though I should clarify that Edward still does update his writings, but they are mostly just new policies for the Town or how to set up Quartz, which is considerably less exciting, than say for example, <a href="https://obsidiannotes-v-4.pages.dev/04-03-2023-the-town-analogy/">the Town analogy</a> or <a href="https://obsidiannotes-v-4.pages.dev/09-04-2023-A-change-in-course/">his ‘change’ in ‘course’</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>How nice would that be, if the production of the Town outpaced the speed at which you could read it. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
