<p>What requires less energy gets done. What requires more energy doesn’t. This principle can applied for all things in the world, including human behaviour. Habits that are difficult aren’t done.

<p>CSL Oral Exam [!Important]- Chinese Stimulus 在2019年我和我家人一起坐飞机去了中国，我们去了北京、上海、西安和桂林，一共去了两个星期。在北京我们过了五夜，我们参观了很多名胜古迹，比如：故宫（紫禁城）、颐和园、天坛和长城。我印象最深的是爬长城，虽然很累，但是我很自豪，那天我爬到了最高点。然后，我们从北京坐高铁到了上海，我们在上海过了三夜，我们在上海还买了很多衣服、文具等等，又便宜又漂亮。我们再次坐高铁到西安，在西安过了两夜，我们参观了兵马俑、大雁塔和古城墙。我们还坐飞机到了桂林，在桂林过了两夜，桂林的风景特别漂亮最后，我们从桂林坐飞机回到珀斯。我在中国吃了很多好吃的中国菜，比如：北京烤鸭、饺子、小笼包、蒸鱼和拉面。我觉得这次旅行非常有意思 [!QUESTION]- 你喜欢交什么样的朋友？你喜欢什么样的人做朋友？ 我喜欢交喜欢学习的朋友，因为我们可以在学习上互相帮助。另外，我最喜欢友善和幽默的朋友，而且，和我有相同的兴趣、爱好和志同道合的朋友。 [!QUESTION]- 你周末常常和朋友做些什么？ 周末的时候，我通常跟好朋友一起打电脑游戏。我一般跟Edward和Henry不但一起玩儿Minecraft，而且有时候也一起玩儿skribbl.io，因为这两个游戏都很好玩。另外，我们还会在Discord上互相发短信。 [!QUESTION]- 谈谈你最好的朋友。 我最好的朋友叫Edward。他的头发是黑色的，眼睛也是黑色的。另外，他长得不高也不矮。他的性格很好，不仅友善，而且很幽默。他聪明极了，因为他会打多种电脑游戏。我常常跟Edward一起打Minecraft, 有时候我们也会一起去中国餐馆吃饭。我和他在一起感到非常开心。 [!QUESTION]- 交朋友时你遇到过什么问题？ 因为我是一个性格内向的人，所以我不喜欢跟其他人说话。因此，每次和别人说话，我都会不知道应该说些什么。尤其是和新认识的人说话的时候，我会觉得很淡漠。 [!QUESTION]- 谈谈你最喜欢的老师。 我最喜欢的老师是中文老师：李老师，她长得不高不矮，她的头发长长的、黑黑的，很漂亮。她的性格很随和，还常常鼓励我们。她教得很好，也很认真。她让我对学中文很感兴趣，中文是我最喜欢科目，因为学中文不但有意思，而且有用极了。除此以外，她也不给我们太多作业。 [!QUESTION]- 谈谈你知道的中国节日？你觉得哪个节日最有意思？为什么？ 我知道中国有很多传统节日，比如：春节、中秋节和端午节。我觉得最有意思的节日是春节，因为春节是最重要，也是最大的传统节日。春节前，人们大扫除、贴春联和“福”字。除夕时，一家人团聚在一起吃年夜饭。人们一般都会吃年糕、饺子、桔子和鱼。年糕代表“年年高升”。饺子的形状像“元宝”，代表“发财”。桔子代表“大吉大利”。鱼代表“年年有余”。而且中国人会放烟花和鞭炮，长辈给晚辈“压岁钱”，又叫“红包”。春节期间，人们穿新衣、拜年、看舞龙舞狮，到处都很热闹。 [!QUESTION]- 什么是中春节？中国人怎么庆祝春节？ 我知道中国有很多传统节日，比如：春节、中秋节和端午节。我觉得最有意思的节日是春节，因为春节是最重要，也是最大的传统节日。春节前，人们大扫除、贴春联和“福”字。除夕时，一家人团聚在一起吃年夜饭。人们一般都会吃年糕、饺子、桔子和鱼。年糕代表“年年高升”。饺子的形状像“元宝”，代表“发财”。桔子代表“大吉大利”。鱼代表“年年有余”。而且中国人会放烟花和鞭炮，长辈给晚辈“压岁钱”，又叫“红包”。春节期间，人们穿新衣、拜年、看舞龙舞狮，到处都很热闹。 [!QUESTION]- 什么是中秋节？中国人怎么庆祝中秋节？ 中秋节在农历八月十五日，那时在中国是秋天。中秋节时，月亮最大、最圆、最亮。一家人团聚在一起一边吃月饼，一边赏月。中秋节有个美丽的传说，是关于后羿和嫦娥的故事。 [!QUESTION]- 什么是端午节？中国人怎么庆祝端午节？ 端午节在农历五月五号，它是中国的一个传统节日之一，这个节日是为了纪念中国古代伟大的诗人屈原。他的国家灭亡以后，他跳河自杀了。 人们为了不让鱼吃屈原的身体，划船把粽子扔进河里，所以，在端午节时，中国人不但包粽子、吃粽子，而且赛龙舟。 [!QUESTION]- 谈谈中国人喜欢吃的东西和喜欢送的礼物。 春节的时侯，人们不仅会送红包，而且还会吃鱼、包饺子、吃年糕、吃橘子。端午节时，人们送粽子，吃粽子。中秋节时，人们送月饼，节日那天的时候也会吃月饼。 [!QUESTION]- 谈谈你知道的澳大利亚的节日？你觉得哪个澳大利亚的节日最有意思？为什么？ 澳大利亚的节日有新年、复活节和圣诞节。 我觉得新年是最有意思的节日，因为它代表新的开始和改变。在新年时，人们吃烧烤，放烟花，开派对，非常热闹。 [!QUESTION]- 谈谈澳大利亚人喜欢吃的东西和喜欢送的礼物。 大利亚人过圣诞节时，吃火腿、火鸡、海鲜、沙拉和布丁。除此以外，人们还会送各种各样的圣诞礼物， 比如衣服、玩具、巧克力、葡萄酒和书。澳大利亚过复活节时，吃巧克力蛋、巧克力兔子和十字面包。同时，人们也会把巧克力蛋和巧克力兔子送给别人作为礼物。 [!QUESTION]- 你喜欢旅行吗?为什么？ 我非常喜欢旅行。因为旅行能让我开阔眼界、增长知识，也能参观名胜古迹，看漂亮的风景，还能品尝各种各样的食物，除此以外，还能了解不同国家的文化和风土人情。...</p>

<p>Stimulus 我选这张照片。 这是一张我和朋友在图书馆的照片。我们每个星期三和星期五放学后都在图书馆学习，因为在这两天我们学校放学很早。虽然我记不清，但是我觉得我们大多数时间学化学或英语。 在学习方面，我们互相帮助，共同进步。我觉得他们都很聪明，而且他们的科目都学得很好，每次考试都考得很好。我们总是在一起讨论数学和化学问题。我们几个朋友中，中文学得最好的学生当然是Pranav，他常常帮助我学中文。我想赶上他，甚至想超过他。 和我关系最好的是Edward，我们总是谈关于各种各样的话题，比如：游戏、笑话儿、世界新闻，等等。另外，我们还常常一起设计网页。 我常常跟这些朋友们不仅一起学习，而且还一起玩儿，我们常常一边打球，一边聊天。除此以外，我们也总是一起出去吃饭。我们总是有说不完的话，有时候我们会开开玩笑，有时候我们会说说学校里的事情，有时候我们会谈谈政治和世界新闻，等等。甚至放学回家后，我们还在网上聊天。在周末和假期，我们常常一起郊游和打电脑游戏。 总之，我非常喜欢跟我的朋友们在一起，我希望我们永远是朋友。 Questions: Having Fun 你喜欢什么运动?/ 谈谈你喜欢的运动。 我最喜欢的运动是打羽毛球，因为我的很多朋友也打羽毛球，我可以和他们一起打羽毛球。还有，打羽毛球不仅很刺激，而且也让我们保持健康。虽然打羽毛球和打网球很相似，但是不一样。 你周末做些什么?在哪儿? 和谁一起? 我周末有时候在我家跟好朋友一起打电脑游戏，有时候我和家人一起去公园。每个星期六上午我和妹妹去游泳池游泳。我常常星期天早上从九点到十点一刻跟英文家教学习英文，但是现在我自己学习英文。 你经常一边学习一边听音乐吗? 我常常一边学习一边听音乐，因为我觉得听音乐不仅能让我更专心学习，而且让我放松。我最喜欢一边学习一边听古典音乐。 你喜欢听什么音乐? 我喜欢听所有的音乐，比如：古典音乐、流行音乐、说唱等等。但是，我非常讨厌韩国流行音乐。 你最喜欢的歌星是谁? 你没有喜欢的歌星。 你喜欢看什么电影? 我最喜欢看喜剧片，因为喜剧片很好笑，让我很放松，看喜剧片可以减轻我的学习压力。 你最喜欢的电影明星是谁? 我最喜欢的电影明星是成龙，我喜欢看他演的功夫电影，特别是《功夫熊猫》。 你今年选了哪些科目? 今年我学六个科目：中文、化学、物理、英语文学、两门数学。我非常喜欢中文和物理，因为它们都很有趣。而且中文老师和物理老师都对我们很好。虽然物理很难，但是我学得不错。因为学中文很有用，而且我对中国文化感兴趣，所以我特别喜欢学中文，我希望我的中文水平能有更大的提高。 你喜欢上什么课? /你最喜欢那些科目? 我非常喜欢中文和物理，因为它们都很有趣。而且中文老师和物理老师都对我们很好。虽然物理很难，但是我学得很好。因为学中文很有用，而且我对中国文化感兴趣，所以我特别喜欢学中文，我希望我的中文水平能有更大的提高。 你哪门课的成绩最好? 现在我的两门数学成绩都最好，每次考试都得九十几分。 你为什么学中文? 我学中文四年多了。我非常喜欢学中文。我觉得中文不但很有用，而且非常有趣。中文很有用，因为世界上有九亿三左右的人说中文。学好中文我可以和他们用中文交流。还有，现在中国经济发展很快，很多公司需要会说中文的雇员，学好中文，我会有更多的工作机会。我觉得中文很有趣，因为它和英文非常不同，而且我觉得中国字非常美，像画一样。除此以外，我还对中国文化非常感兴趣，也喜欢吃中国菜。 你学中文多久了? 我学中文四年多了。 除了中文以外，你还学了什么科目? 除了中文以外，我还学了五个科目：化学、物理、英语文学、两门数学。 你每星期/每天有几节课? 每星期我们有二十八节课。在星期一、星期二、星期四，我们有六节课，但是在星期三和星期五我们有五节课。 你下课后都做什么? 在星期三和星期五放学后，我跟朋友一起去图书馆学习一个小时。在星期一，放学后我和妹妹去打羽毛球。在星期二，我去辅导老师家学中文。学习完了以后，我有时候会和朋友一起设计网页。 你怎样安排你的学习时间? 每天放学后，我不是和朋友一起去图书馆学习，就是回家学习。晚上，我还学习三个半小时。周末我也学习五个小时，我喜欢学习。 你学习上遇到过什么困难? 当我学习英语文学和中文时，我常常不明白老师讲的东西。我得回家慢慢地自己学，才能明白。有时候我会要我的朋友帮助我，或我问我的辅导老师。 怎样学习才能取得好成绩？ 我觉得只要认真听课，回家复习，多做练习，就能取得好成绩。另外，取得好成绩的最好办法是多做过去的考试卷。 你怎样安排你的课余活动和学习?...</p>

在学习方面，我们互相帮助，共同进步。我觉得他们都很聪明，而且他们的科目都学得很好，每次考试都考得很好。我们总是在一起讨论数学和化学问题。我们几个朋友中，中文学得最好的学生当然是Pranav，他常常帮助我学中文。我想赶上他，甚至想超过他。

和我关系最好的是Edward，我们总是谈关于各种各样的话题，比如：游戏、笑话儿、世界新闻，等等。另外，我们还常常一起做东西，例如：我们一起设计网站。

我常常跟这些朋友们不仅一起学习，而且还一起玩儿，我们常常一边打球，一边聊天。除此以外，我们也总是一起出去吃饭。我们总是有说不完的话，有时候我们会开开玩笑，有时候我们会说说学校里的事情，有时候我们会谈谈政治和世界新闻，等等。甚至放学回家后，我们还在网上聊天。在周末和假期，我们常常一起郊游和打游戏机。

<p>you measured the time it took for the trolley to move. but how do we turn that into acceleration? well it’s pretty easy. first you want to apply the motion equations. specifically the “s = ut + 0.5at^2”. we can rearrange this to get a = (s + ut) /...</p>
