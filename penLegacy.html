    <p>i’m copying <a href="https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/18-02-2023-The-Legend-of-0-point-38mm">ed’s idea</a> ;-)</p>

<h2 id="pentel-techniclick-05">pentel techniclick 0.5</h2>

<p>this is not a pen, it’s a mechanical pencil. but it was my old reliable for a very long time now. and it’s a solid pencil (9/10). it works well and it’s got a funny push mechanism. a good amount of pencil lead will leave you writing for months<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. the only criticism i have is that it is kind of easy to press the button, but that’s only a little thing. also be careful with the clipping thing, because it’s really easy to break. some of my friends<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> also used to use this and all of their clipping things broke as well.</p>

<h2 id="bic-cristal">bic cristal</h2>

<p>literally everyone knows this pen. not much to say. cheap, writes everywhere, but it’s a ballpoint pen, and it hurts to write with.</p>

<p>20/20<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>-5 because hand hurt ;-(.</p>

<h2 id="mg-en-gel-k-35">m&amp;g en-gel k-35</h2>

<p>i got this as a gift. much different to bic cristal, this is a gel pen. and so it writes well, and is fluid. sometimes it doesn’t write, but that’s okay. apart from that, not too much to add tbh. it also has a very satisfying click sound :-).</p>

<p>solid 37/35 (-0.2 for not writing sometimes).</p>
