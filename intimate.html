    <p>I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the Town feels a lot more… hollow? Empty? Cold? Especially with the possible arrival of a new member (Binyan), I feel increasingly that the Town is no longer the warm and intimate, closely-knit community, and that everyone is a little ‘uncomfortable’, and the 20-person DM group style communication does not really help.</p>

<p>What if we were able to have smaller, more intimate communities, while still maintaining the overall idea of the Town. What if we split our Town into… ‘Districts’?</p>

<hr />

<p>Let us consider a scenario with 26 people (let’s call them A, B, C, so on). Now, D and P and Q and B feel a little uncomfortable in this 26 person group chat. Sure, they are all aligned by the same goal, and all of them are good people, but they aren’t exactly ‘close’. With the current system, BDPQ have to just deal with it.</p>

<p>However, under this system, BDPQ can choose to form another, smaller, community. A district, in which they can do whatever.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This could be Town-government approve or not, it does not really matter.</p>

<hr />

<p>The experiment: Create a district of a few people. If the previously inactive people are more active in the new district, it is (probably) a success.</p>

<h2 id="other-advantages">Other advantages?</h2>

<p>Well, on top of making people just a tad bit more comfortable, it might also allow districts to work as proxies for people joining the Town. These districts will predominately be composed of Town members, however, if a prospecting person needs help, instead of being funnelled to the big Town (i.e. Edward (Quartz), Loren (Notion), or me (Jekyll)). This might help first let them get comfortable, as well as creating a more tightly knit community.</p>

<h2 id="other-disadvantages">Other disadvantages?</h2>

<p>Well, if it goes too far, it may just possibly lead to the fragmentation of the Town, but (I believe) we are reaching a critical point anyways and that’s a problem for future pr</p>

      <p>Of course, these districts are not illegal (currently), however, it would kind of be nice to normalise it I guess. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
