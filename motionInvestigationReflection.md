... i am scared. all of the questions were worth so little. this is psychological warfare. do i write lots and the marks are very heavy? or do i write little because only a little bit. i am quite afraid.

i am worried about this assessment task. the in-class seemed a little *too* easy. and this puts me off, especially when everyone is still writing. i might be screwed. i might be screwed. i might be screwed. this is not good. please for the love of god, please be loosely marked. i might be ducked otherwise.
