**the web is more commerical** and i don't mean from a "buy this" point of view. i mean from a **"everything applies to business"** point of view. when i search up what the hell "Re:" actually means in an email, i **don't want to see** blog posts about how putting "Re:" actually decreases **click-through rate**. i want to know what it means, and if regular, living, breathing people use it.

*proposal*: how do you fix this? i've got no clue.
