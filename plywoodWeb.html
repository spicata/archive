  <p><em>When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through</em><br />

<p>this is not how we should make the web. of course, having a beautiful back-end is good, but there is no pressure to make it beautiful. and also, us regular people are too poor to make a drawer out of beautiful wood. we’d use plywood.</p>

<p>there is honestly no need to create a perfect website. don’t listen to wix, squarespace, or whatever other website builders tell you. also, don’t listen to those <a href="companyBlogs">company blogs</a> that say setting up a website is hard. sure, it’s hard if you are trying to make some really grand project, but for most, a simple website works well enough. there is no need to make it out of beautiful mahogany, when plywood works.</p>

<p>also, there are supposedly many different types of plywood, and many different qualities. it is also supposedly surprisingly durable or something. hell, they even made a plane out of it. if you can use plywood well, you can beat regular wood.</p>
