Politics seems to have taken over the Town, and in doing so, seems to have misled us from the main focus of the Town, a personal community working together to make notes. Instead it has divided us, and bred competition among our ranks. We are labelled with arbitrary terms: Notionites, Jekyllers, Quartzers. Terms that were once used to merely classify the style of the websites have become the de facto political parties of the Town.

The Town is not a country, nor is it a governmental system. The Town is a community of people, an organisation of like-minded individuals. Why must we get into politics, when it merely distracts us from our goal. I believe that we need a mayor that is merely an enforcer of the will of the people, not a person to lead. And a program to calm the politics within the Town.
