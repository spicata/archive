It's been a year since I've made a website. Many things have changed since then, but life's still good. I've had my fair share of happy time, hardships, and conflicts, but I would not go back and change anything. Across this one year, I think I grew, and learnt, a lot more than I would have ever dreamed. Things about you, things about me, and things about the world.

[I was originally going to write a history of my website journey, but instead, I want to write a thank you note to you guys, my friends, the people who stuck around]: #

However, the most impactful thing on my journey here was the friends and other people I met along the way, and I just wanted to say, thanks.

To the NDCS players, it was such a blast playing Minecraft with all of you, and your ruthless efficiency. Due to your hardwork, we were able to create such a glorious Town, new buildings built upon the foundations of others, the three huts at the start, the cow farm and the Sayori room, the community hub, Sayori the llama, the wheat plantations, Pi-thagoras' and Max's houses, and the Wall. Thank you so much for sticking around 'til the end of the server. It was a shame that we were unable to finish the game as we intended, but it was fun while it lasted, and ended with a bang.

To Horror Game Saturday, the playthrough of DDLC was very fun, thanks again to Junsung and Henry for hosting it for us. Being able to play as "pranavborude" was a wild ride, and I wish we are able to something with that calibre again (Until Dawn is not it guys).

To the Town Minecraft players, the shenanigans still echo in my head. Joel shouting angrily after falling on a stalagmite one too many times, hanging out with Loren and Joel at the campsite, and building a bridge. Running away from the centre, living along, and finding Edward hiding. Planting a cherry grove with Shan-mei. It was so fun playing with all of you, and I hope we do so again.

To the rest of the Town, thank you for allowing me to be a part of such a wonderful and vibrant group of people, all with their own ideas and thoughts. I wish you all find some value in this little project we have all decided to embark on.

To all my friends, thanks again for being there for me. You guys are all wonderful people, and I really enjoy the time I spent with all of you guys: the late night debates, the class times we spent goofing around, or the times we spent studying. You guys are great.

And to you, the miscellaneous viewer. Thanks for reading my rather useless things.

Thank you, the end.
