> "Perfect is the enemy of good" - Voltaire

In attempting to create a perfect object, we will always come up short; no artist can create the objectively perfect artwork. Similarly, we won't be able to create perfect notes, and we *should not try to*. Doing so will only hammer your output. Instead, upload your notes regularly, because here, we work in the public.

When we work in the public, others are there to judge our work, and to correct our mistakes. Like bitter medicine, each critique will sting, but in the end it will correct our gaps on knowledge. This is what we gain when we work in the public. We do not need to try to be perfect, as there will be people to correct us.

We need to create a system or environment that allows us to scrutinise each others works[^1], in order to develop our own knowledge. This will require work, but I believe it will greatly increase the quality of our thoughts and notes by the end.
