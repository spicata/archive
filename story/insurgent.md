A government has issued an update on the Trans-desert train. According to said update, part of the train has been occupied by insurgent forces, calling themselves the G Syndicate. There are military and police forces in the process of quelling this rebellion.

Private citizens are advised to not use the Trans-desert train during this time. The train will begin operating once this skirmish has been stopped.

We thank you for your cooperation.
