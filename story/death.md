A little note lays on the floor:

> In other news, a new death has been assigned to the desert. He's efficient, sure, but impatient. Unrelated: if he comes, you can see him from a distance, always carrying that eerie green glow. A little stylistic choice of the future, I guess. Rumour has it that he's got new armour and tools. Death Co doesn't seem pleased that we were able to pick off that last guy by simply running a bus into him.

The rest of it is unreadable scribbles.
