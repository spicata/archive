No-one inherently begins with a hue of Purple; this colour, unlike most is earned. Earned by dedicating their lives to aiding, defending, and healing others. It is truly a noble colour, and those who don it can be seen as the bastions of a harmonious society. They are treated with a level of reverence only available to those who harness their skills to better society.

Saying that, there comes some ability unique to those who follow this path:

- A hardiness and longevity, as if bestowed by Life itself
- The ability to harm mortal wounds
- (the rest is indiscernible)
