It is with the greatest pleasure that announce the opening of... the Trans-desert Train!

With over 700 km of track, it connects the Metropolis to the Exterior. With additional stops in between, the is truly the mode of transportation for all. To add to that, the first 10 000 customers get 50% off, so rush to the nearest train station!

Places are limited, so come take yours today. We'll make sure you see the world.
