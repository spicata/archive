    <p>No-one inherently begins with a hue of Purple; this colour, unlike most is earned. Earned by dedicating their lives to aiding, defending, and healing others. It is truly a noble colour, and those who don it can be seen as the bastions of a harmonious society. They are treated with a level of reverence only available to those who harness their skills to better society.</p>

<p>Saying that, there comes some ability unique to those who follow this path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A hardiness and longevity, as if bestowed by Life itself</li>
  <li>The ability to harm mortal wounds</li>
  <li>(the rest is indiscernible)</li>
</ul>
