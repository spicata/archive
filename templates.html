    <p>templates are a little bit like functions. you put an input into a little black box, and you get a result. then you use that result. however, just like function, templates have the little problem called ‘i have no clue what goes on inside that box’.</p>

<p>templates are also rather robust, but also inflexible. They work well if you use it exactly the way it was designed to be used, however, if you deviate a little from that, it kind of breaks. Also, due to it’s inflexibility, editing it can be difficult, which can be seen as Quartz, as well as with when Shan-mei used <a href="https://pages-themes.github.io/primer/">Primer</a> and Dasindu using <a href="https://pages-themes.github.io/tactile/">Tactile</a> (the last two was very difficult to add custom HTML and CSS, whilst Quartz works, except not everyone ‘gets’ it).</p>

<p>This is the problem with templates. It’s useful, but does not work when it should.</p>
