      <p>you know, i can have different html for different pages using jekyll. it’s pretty cool i think. yeah i’m up to some tomfoolery. it’s pretty funny.</p>

    </div>
    <footer>
      <p><small>woah, this bottom bit changed! well, this is normally a piece of the html, but i edited the html. but it's cool because this doesn't actually impact any other pages because it is for a specific layout called fun. life is good :-)</small></p>
