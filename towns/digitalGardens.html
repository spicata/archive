    <p>“huh, what’s this?”</p>

<p>This is essentially the question I asked myself at the very start of what has became the town. One day, after spending too much time on the internet, I end up stumbling into the rabbit hole of ‘digital gardens’.</p>

<p>Simply going off of what I remember, digital gardens a new way of ‘thinking’ of website; essentially like a website philosophy. There would be lots of interconnected, interrelated notes, that were constantly updated. It would start at a seed, a single idea, and would go up the ‘hierarchy’ of notes, eventually becoming flowering tree. However, if unmaintained, it would again rot away, and so it would require constant maintenance. The website builder/note-takers role is to create a path through these gardens, something not too sterile, but also not too wild.</p>

<p>This was essentially the basis of my very original website. At the time, I was very stuck within the… what can be called the Obsidian hype phase, where I would think of Obsidian — the note taking app I use — as kind of a way of thinking I guess. I was a little overzealous. I was obsessed with the graph view, with linking my notes together, and so the idea of creating this beautiful pathway through my notes was very enticing.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Somewhere back in my head, I also had the idea that, if we all worked together, then we could create this mega-resource that everyone, including the people of the future, could also use. Both of these things came together, and I think that’s the main reason I made my website at first. Of course, there would have been lots of other reasons, things don’t arise spontaneously as a result of one or two stimuli.</p>

<p>But let’s just go with this nice little narrative. I settled this town, at the very start, not because of corporations, and not because of the community. I made this town, so that I could create a little, beautiful park that you could loose yourself in, while bestowing the minuscule part of worldly knowledge on you. That dream is long gone now, but the garden idea has stuck.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, I think that Obsidian is just an okay app that functions well and supports Commonmark (I’m pretty sure). The gleam of it has kind of faded away. I don’t spend my time looking at the themes and the plugins, or trying to find new functionalities. The only thing I usually find is new Markdown documentations, which allows me to find newer ways of doing things I once thought impossible.</p>

      <p>Pretty sure Ed does still do think that about Obsidian though. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
