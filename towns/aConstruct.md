Imagine this. A massive organisation of people --- working like a well-oiled machine --- together sharing notes and other pieces of information. A weapon of education. A closely knit group that would create great things among their ranks.

That was the thoughts that once ran through my head. Me and my friends had this group called 'The Hive Mind', which was essentially where we would occasionally help each other. I once dreamed that this Hive Mind might be able to grow into a massive group project that would catapult each other into the stratosphere. This was what I called 'The Construct'.

You might have heard of it around my website before, I know I have mentioned it at least once. Sometimes, I sit back an think that it might have been a cool project. But I know that it was intended to be used as a 'weapon' of sort, something that would unfairly advantage others. The Construct was something many people worked together to build; much unlike the Town, which is the community of people that it comprises it. It was something to build **towards**, but not something that would tie people together much past that.

I like the Town we have made. I like how it is now. I like how I can sit on the outskirts, watching it flourish. I like how I don't need to fear that it will turn on me, and I like how it can work without me. I like the Town, and certainly like the people who live in it too.
