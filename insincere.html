    <p>I feel that talking is an insincere means of communication, at least for me. I don’t feel you are able to capture the most amount of stuff you want to say in speaking. Writing is much slower, and so I find it easier to actually say stuff.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t get interrupted, so yeah. So if you ever get a thank you note or something through writing, and not speech, it’s cause of this.</p>
