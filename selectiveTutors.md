to the tutors who only tutor smart children.

what is the point of tutoring only people who pass your standardised test or whatever. if the point of tutoring is to help the students, then surely you'd tutor everyone. if my tutor has no confidence to turn a bad student into a good one, what confidence can i have that they'd turn a good student into a great one?[^1] a great one into a brilliant one? if the tutor only chases prestige, it is painfully obvious to the consumers, the students and their parents. **but what is in it for you?** well, if you tutor bad children, firstly they will probably pay. secondly, if you able to turn a bad student into a good one, that's even more prestige and signals your reliability to the consumers. thirdly, that student will probably stay with you out of loyalty and trust. 'cause [sentimental value](sentimentalValue).

*proposal*: life is not fun without challenges. take them head on, come out stronger.
