    <blockquote>
  <p>To Edward and Frederick</p>

  <p>Sleep is essential for learning. Firstly, it allows you to learn more by pushing your memories into long term storage. This is usually done during stage 3 of sleep. REM sleep benefits critical thinking skills, which is also beneficial, especially when doing examinations and other complex tasks. If you do not get enough sleep, your focus, judgement, and mood all get degraded. To add to that, even if you get enough sleep, if you sleep too late, you will not reap the benefits.</p>
