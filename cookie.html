<p>If you chance a visit around all of the Town’s pages, you may notice a slight pattern. Specifically, have a look at these people’s websites: Edward, Reaper, Thomas, Jonathan, Ajay, Tom, Athu, Joel.</p>

<p>All of their websites and very similar, it would be remiss to deny it. This is because they are all based on the same Hugo template called Quartz.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before we continue, I would like to address one misconception that I think many — even Edward — has about how Jekyll and Quartz work. At its core, Jekyll is fundamentally different to Quartz. Jekyll is a static site generator, an application that creates (well) a static site. It’s counterpart would be Hugo, an SSG programmed in Go. Jekyll is an application of sorts.</p>

<p>Quartz is merely a Hugo template. It, in itself, is not an SSG. It is a template to said SSG. This occurs with Jekyll as well, there are tons of different ones. The reason I built — and I presume for all the other Jekyll users — is because the Jekyll templates do not fit our goal nor our personalities. So we opted to put in some extra work in order to make something that is ours.</p>

<hr />

<p>Quartz is a very useful Hugo template coded by <a href="https://jzhao.xyz">Jacky Zhao</a>. The reason it’s so popular within the Town is probably because it meshes well with <a href="https://obsidian">Obsidian</a>, which is a note-taking app that is widely used in the Town.</p>

<p>However, this brings me to my belief that, at least in the Town, Quartz has become a cookie-cutter solution (I fear that this might happen to Notion as well). Each one has its own flair, sure, but I don’t believe the differences are large enough (except in the case of Edward’s website) in order to fully justify not calling it this.</p>

<p>The extent of the differences between the pages are mostly just a few colour changes and font changes.</p>

<p>So what? Well, I want to see a more diverse Town, and I hope you guys can deliver.</p>
