At times, the best way to learn is for someone to hold your hand and lead you through the path designed to keep you safe. Other times, the best way to learn is to run into the metaphorical jungle and learn your way around it alone, as experience is the best teacher.

Learn to survive without the gun, and you will be all the better when you get it. But depend on the gun, and you will be hopeless without it. Discard your template, start with a barebones website. Code your own HTML, your own CSS. Learn how SSGs work, don't depend on what others have made on it to survive.
