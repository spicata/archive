      <p>oh no. there is nothing here! that’s not good.</p>

<p>now, other websites would chastise you and say something like “<strong>you</strong> seem lost”, or “<strong>you</strong> are in the wrong place”, or “this is not the web page <strong>you</strong> are looking for”. they kind of place the blame on you for getting here. i hate that (and i am sure you hate it too), because nine times out of ten, we actually clicked a link and arrived there.</p>

<p>i’m not like that. if you are here, it is most probably my fault. i am very sorry. if i accidentally led you here, please tell me about it, send a letter to spicata@99000000.xyz or talk to me on discord (m.spicata#9966)</p>
