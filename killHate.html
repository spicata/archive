    <p><strong>hate is a bad, terrible thing</strong>. it’s also how a lot of us work. whether we hate this or hate that, <strong>it’s generally bad</strong>. of course, sometimes hate is okay. for example, i hate when people kill other people, because… i think hating murder is normal human behaviour.</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: <strong>stop hating things</strong>. or well… treat them the same way you would treat other things. and if you hate everything… uh… try not to.</p>
