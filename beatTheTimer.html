    <p>if we get a month to finish something, we will finish it in a month. if we get a week, we’ll finish it in a week. if we get a day, we’ll finish it in a day. we tend to <strong>finish things by deadlines</strong>.</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: <strong>set a timer</strong>. you can guesstimate how long it will take, or just stick to the pomodoro. then find something to finish during this time. then <strong>try to finish</strong> it <strong>before the time runs out</strong>. beat the timer.</p>
