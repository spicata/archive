This was Edward's reaction to me seizing power from him and — according to him — going 'too far' with my zealousness. I am situated at a similar situation right now, with Edward as mayo. I see his actions as brash and unsupervised. However, I am not Edward, and I believe that, if this truly is the way he sees the Town, he is missing a crucial bit of it.

Where is the work? The Town *should* be safe, collaborative, and encouraging. But, this only deals with the 'people' problem, and it fails to address the fact that the Town should also be effective. Maybe not efficient, but effective. However, due to the [Chen agreement](https://the-toomwn.github.io/votes/Chen%20Agreement.html), I am not allowed in any political positions.

Luckily, I am once again, not Ed, and thus instead of resigning myself to being sad for a night, I bang my head against this problem instead. Because the beauty of the Town is that, for the most part, you don't need a position of power to make new things and alter the Town. You just need to be there, and have a dream, and sometimes also a plan.

That was my late night ramble, just really wanted to write something, and Ed's article was in my mind, so I did.

Thanks again for reading the things I write. :-)
