    <ul>
  <li>Looking at the effects of colonialism (spec. eu colonial) on the world.
    <ul>
      <li>both pos and neg</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>col is eu-centric
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. the values of the eu spread across the world</li>
      <li>also eu values are commonly seen as univeral (universalism)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>decolisation is only seen as mil and political
    <ul>
      <li>however cultural influences</li>
      <li>indigenous ‘programmed’ to believe that col values are good, original culture is bad (inferior) (double vision)
        <ul>
          <li>this double consciouness is unstable (sense of self).</li>
          <li>heightened by forced migration (causes diaspora)</li>
          <li>causes the feeling of being between, but not belonging to, two cultures</li>
          <li>creates unhomeliness (Homi Bhabbha) != homeless, rather feeling lack of home while having a home (psychological refugee)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>orietalism relates to asia (but is an invention of the west)
    <ul>
      <li>asia depicted as x to show that west is y</li>
      <li>y is usually a good thing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>also related to ‘othering’
    <ul>
      <li>colonialism splits people into us (ingroup) and other (outgroup) (usually the colonised)</li>
      <li>sometimes other people are depicted as brutal and savage (demonic other)</li>
      <li>sometimes shown as beautiful due to their connection to nature (bcos of their primality) (exotic other)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>use of english itself is submitting to colonialism + not easy to rediscover past
    <ul>
      <li>also postcol identity is dynamic i.e. affected by both native and col cultures (a syncretism)</li>
      <li>but also finding native identity is a matter of identity and purpose + resisting col culture. (nativism/nationalism)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>parallels feminism (+ postcol women)</li>
  <li>cultural imperialism - the way that the culture of a colonised societies become imitations of the colonial power
    <ul>
      <li>is postcol itself a part of cultural imperalism?</li>
      <li>the people who write it is definitely educated, not part of the people with inferior status</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>or a focus on “unspoken, unrepresented pasts that haunt the historical present” (Bhabha)</li>
  <li>racism breaks corporeal schema (ourselves as physical presences) → racial epidermal schema (just a black body) #danger
    <ul>
      <li>‘not only must the black man be black; he must be black in relation to the white man’ (fanon)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>col &gt; suppress independece
    <ul>
      <li>alienates + dominates i.e. attacks very essence of identity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
