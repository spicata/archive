- Looking at the effects of colonialism (spec. eu colonial) on the world.
    - both pos and neg
- col is eu-centric
    - e.g. the values of the eu spread across the world
    - also eu values are commonly seen as univeral (universalism)
- decolisation is only seen as mil and political
    - however cultural influences
    - indigenous 'programmed' to believe that col values are good, original culture is bad (inferior) (double vision)
        - this double consciouness is unstable (sense of self).
        - heightened by forced migration (causes diaspora)
        - causes the feeling of being between, but not belonging to, two cultures
        - creates unhomeliness (Homi Bhabbha) != homeless, rather feeling lack of home while having a home (psychological refugee)
- orietalism relates to asia (but is an invention of the west)
    - asia depicted as x to show that west is y
    - y is usually a good thing
- also related to 'othering'
    - colonialism splits people into us (ingroup) and other (outgroup) (usually the colonised)
    - sometimes other people are depicted as brutal and savage (demonic other)
    - sometimes shown as beautiful due to their connection to nature (bcos of their primality) (exotic other)
- use of english itself is submitting to colonialism + not easy to rediscover past
    - also postcol identity is dynamic i.e. affected by both native and col cultures (a syncretism)
    - but also finding native identity is a matter of identity and purpose + resisting col culture. (nativism/nationalism)
- parallels feminism (+ postcol women)
- cultural imperialism - the way that the culture of a colonised societies become imitations of the colonial power
    - is postcol itself a part of cultural imperalism?
    - the people who write it is definitely educated, not part of the people with inferior status
- or a focus on "unspoken, unrepresented pasts that haunt the historical present" (Bhabha)
- racism breaks corporeal schema (ourselves as physical presences) → racial epidermal schema (just a black body) #danger
    - ‘not only must the black man be black; he must be black in relation to the white man’ (fanon)
- col > suppress independece
    - alienates + dominates i.e. attacks very essence of identity
- ### look at the impact that colonialism has on ppl essentially

## common topics:

- native and colonial first encounter + disruption of culture
- eu person journey w/ native guide
- othering + oppression
- mimicry
- exile (from own land)
- post-independent excitement -> disillusion
- struggle of culture identity (+ alienation, unhomeliness, double vision, hybridity).
- continuing native past + self-definition

## q's to ask

- how does text represent aspects of col oppression ++political/cultural oppression overlaps
- what does it reveal about problem of postcol indentity? personal-cultural + double vision & hybridity
- revealing bout politics + psychology of anti-col resistance?
- operations of cultural diff
- responding to character/topics/assumptions of colonialist work?
- similarites between different postcol populations?
- text in western canon reinforce or undermine col ideology?

## flow... chart?

- in order to subjugate → they are different → i.e. less human → othering → subjugate
- thus, eu society used the savagery of natives as a justification
- racism and classism and sexism as a means of othering
