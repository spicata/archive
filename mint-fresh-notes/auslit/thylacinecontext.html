    <p>The thylacine — also known as the Tasmanian tiger — was a native animal to Australia and Tasmania, now extinct. However, the historical story of the thylacine can be used in order to read Bruce Pascoe’s short story <em>Thylacine</em>, and can also be seen as reflecting the Indigenous cultures of Australia following Western colonisation.</p>

<p>The extinction of the thylacine began during the settlement of European colonisers in Australia. During this time, it was preyed on by newly introduced species, such as the red fox, feral cats, and dogs. Additionally, the displacement of other native animals of Australia into the natural habitat of the thylacine (as a result of settlement) added to the competition that these creatures faced.</p>

<p>However, the final nail in the coffin of the thylacine would have been the public image it had accrued. Despite being a relatively harmless animal<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, it was vilified and depicted as a pest that would prey upon livestock, prompting the government and farmers to work together in order to exterminate the thylacine.</p>

<p>This development can be seen as mirroring the plight of the Indigenous Peoples of Australia, being portrayed as below the Western colonisers, and then the subsequent destruction of their culture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He saw Clarrie with the shotgun”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to this, we can see the thylacine (throughout the story) as a symbol or an extended metaphor for the culture of Aboriginal Australians, and their destruction by the Western settlers, as seen when Clarrie<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> shoots the thylacine at the end (unaware of what he had killed). Also, the attribution of an animal in order to represent Aboriginals may represent how Western settlers had used to see them (as animals).</p>

<hr />

<p>However, following the extinction of the thylacine, its uniqueness resulting in it becoming an icon of Tasmania, and also that of Australia as a whole (ironic). Despite being confirmed (at least so far) to be extinct, there are occasionally supposedly wild thylacine sightings, serving as a sign of hope for the survival of this extinct species.</p>

<p>Similarly, the sighting of the thylacine by Douglas could represent either the hope that the natural beauty of Australia, or the unique Indigenous cultures, returns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the man became just another night animal”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote could be seen as Douglas stepping down from the myths of Western supremacy, in order to actually empathise with Indigenous peoples (humbling himself)</p>

      <p>Unlike wild dogs, cats, and foxes, the thylacine did not prey on chickens regularly, and would steer clear when they sensed that humans would be nearby. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>In a sense, Clarrie can be seen as a synecdochal of the general Western population, and the “blood on Clarrie’s finger” could be a a way of saying that the destruction of nature and of Aboriginal culture</p>

      <p>Douglas believing that “Moonlight nights were terrible after that” could possibly indicate a sense of regret or guilt that he faces. Also inhibits his ability to appreciate the nature around him. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
