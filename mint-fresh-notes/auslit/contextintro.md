This short story, *Thylacine*, gets it's name (as I'm sure you would know), from the thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger. As a previous group had stated, titles are not chosen arbitrarily, and the inclusion of this now extinct animal hints at the large significance of it through-out the story. From the quick run-down provided

- The story gets its name form the thyalcine
- Now as a previou sgroup had mentioned the name f these storys are not chosen abritraily, and thos, along with the inclusion of the thylacne thoughout the text hints tt the singnifcant role that it plays. As we can see form the plot synposis provided, this, is infact true, the thylacine does play a major role in the plot of this story. However, out of curiosity, i decided to research the context of the thylacine as an animal, and i now believe that the history of the thylacine can be used in order to understand this text.
- As some context, the thylacine is, or rather was a native animal to australia. however, due to natural causes, it extinct in mianlna,d limited to tasmani.
- discovered by eu settlers when they clonised australia, but qiickyl labelled as pests. this was under the belief that they would hunt the livestock that the settlers had brought, such as chicekn and sheep. in fact, there was a photo that was circulated with a thylacine eating a chook.
- although this was found to be false, the thylacine was actually held in captivity, the damage had been done. the thylacine now had a public image, and this lead to its extinction. farmers and bounty hunters would now hunt these animals. it soon went extinct.
- however, this is not how we remember the thylacine, as it quickyl became an icon for tas + aus. the scarcity lead to its sudden valuation. the thylacine is now a national icon, and its supposed sightings act as a signal of hope for the animals survival.
- i believe that the history of the thylacine in a way mirrors the history of the australian wildelife and the history of indigenous culture, and that the thylacine within the text is synechdocal/representative
