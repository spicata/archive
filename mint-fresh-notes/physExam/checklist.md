- linear motion and force
    > the one for the test you know?
    * [ ] distinguish between vector and scalar quantities, and add and subtract vectors in two dimensions
    * [ ] uniformly accelerated motion is described in terms of relationships between measurable scalar and vector quantities, including displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration. This includes applying the motions laws
    * [ ] representations, including graphs, vectors, and equations of motion, can be used qualitatively and quantitatively to describe and predict linear motion
    * [ ] vertical motion is analysed by assuming the acceleration due to gravity is constant near Earth’s surface
    * [ ] Newton’s three Laws of Motion describe the relationship between the force or forces acting on an object, modelled as a point mass, and the motion of the object due to the application of the force or forces
    * [ ] free body diagrams show the forces and net force acting on objects, from descriptions of real-life situations involving forces acting in one or two dimensions
    * [ ] momentum is a property of moving objects; it is conserved in a closed system and may be transferred from one object to another when a force acts over a time interval
    * [ ] energy is conserved in isolated systems and is transferred from one object to another when a force is applied over a distance; this causes work to be done and changes the kinetic ( Ek) and/or potential (Ep) energy of objects
    * [ ] collisions may be elastic and inelastic; kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collisions
    * [ ] power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy
- waves
    > the waves one
    * [ ] waves are periodic oscillations that transfer energy from one point to another
    * [ ] mechanical waves transfer energy through a medium; longitudinal and transverse waves are distinguished by the relationship between the directions of oscillation of particles relative to the direction of the wave velocity
    * [ ] waves may be represented by displacement/time and displacement/distance wave diagrams and described in terms of relationships between measurable quantities, including period, amplitude, wavelength, frequency and velocity
    * [ ] the mechanical wave model can be used to explain phenomena related to reflection and refraction, including echoes and seismic phenomena
    * [ ] the superposition of waves in a medium may lead to the formation of standing waves and interference phenomena, including standing waves in pipes and on stretched strings
    * [ ] a mechanical system resonates when it is driven at one of its natural frequencies of oscillation; energy is transferred efficiently into systems under these conditions
    * [ ] the intensity of a wave decreases in an inverse square relationship with distance from a point source
