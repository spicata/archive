  <li>linear motion and force
    <blockquote>
      <p>the one for the test you know?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul class="task-list">
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />distinguish between vector and scalar quantities, and add and subtract vectors in two dimensions</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />uniformly accelerated motion is described in terms of relationships between measurable scalar and vector quantities, including displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration. This includes applying the motions laws</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />representations, including graphs, vectors, and equations of motion, can be used qualitatively and quantitatively to describe and predict linear motion</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />vertical motion is analysed by assuming the acceleration due to gravity is constant near Earth’s surface</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Newton’s three Laws of Motion describe the relationship between the force or forces acting on an object, modelled as a point mass, and the motion of the object due to the application of the force or forces</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />free body diagrams show the forces and net force acting on objects, from descriptions of real-life situations involving forces acting in one or two dimensions</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />momentum is a property of moving objects; it is conserved in a closed system and may be transferred from one object to another when a force acts over a time interval</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />energy is conserved in isolated systems and is transferred from one object to another when a force is applied over a distance; this causes work to be done and changes the kinetic ( Ek) and/or potential (Ep) energy of objects</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />collisions may be elastic and inelastic; kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collisions</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>waves
    <blockquote>
      <p>the waves one</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul class="task-list">
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />waves are periodic oscillations that transfer energy from one point to another</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />mechanical waves transfer energy through a medium; longitudinal and transverse waves are distinguished by the relationship between the directions of oscillation of particles relative to the direction of the wave velocity</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />waves may be represented by displacement/time and displacement/distance wave diagrams and described in terms of relationships between measurable quantities, including period, amplitude, wavelength, frequency and velocity</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />the mechanical wave model can be used to explain phenomena related to reflection and refraction, including echoes and seismic phenomena</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />the superposition of waves in a medium may lead to the formation of standing waves and interference phenomena, including standing waves in pipes and on stretched strings</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />a mechanical system resonates when it is driven at one of its natural frequencies of oscillation; energy is transferred efficiently into systems under these conditions</li>
      <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />the intensity of a wave decreases in an inverse square relationship with distance from a point source</li>
    </ul>
