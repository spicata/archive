    <p>Aim: To investigate the relationship between the acceleration of a system and the external force acting on the system</p>

<p>Background information:</p>

<p>As Newton has showed us, the change in motion (acceleration) is directly proportional to the force. This is known as the second law of motion.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: If the external force acting on the system increases, then the acceleration of the system increases proportionally.</p>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<p>Independent variable: the total external force acting on the system (kg m s^-2)</p>

<p>Dependent variable: the acceleration of the system (m s^-2)</p>

<p>Controlled variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total accelerating mass (0.950kg).</li>
  <li>distance travelled by the system (0.69m +- 0.0005m)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>Materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1x Stopwatch</li>
  <li>6x 50g slotted masses</li>
  <li>1x mass hanger</li>
  <li>1x pulley and clamp</li>
  <li>1x string</li>
  <li>1x Dynamics trolley</li>
  <li>1x 1 metre ruler</li>
  <li>1x 2 metre long track wooden track</li>
</ul>

<p>Method:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clamp pulley onto the end of the wooden track, and place onto the table, ensuring that the side with the pulley stays slightly off the table.</li>
  <li>Place the dynamics trolley on the track facing towards the pulley.</li>
  <li>Wrap a string around the front of the dynamics trolley, and wrap the other end of the string on the mass hanger. Ensure that the string is long enough that the mass hanger can reach the ground when the dynamics trolley is close to the trolley.</li>
  <li>Place the string over the pulley.</li>
  <li>Mark the position where the start of the trolley is on the track when the mass hanger is almost touching the trolley (A).</li>
  <li>Mark the position where the start of the trolley is when the mass hanger is almost touching the floor (B).</li>
  <li>Measure the distance between A and B.</li>
  <li>Place six 50g masses on the dynamics trolley.</li>
  <li>Starting at point A, let go of the trolley and measure the time it takes to reach point B.</li>
  <li>Repeat step 9 three more times.</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 9 and 10, moving a mass from the trolley onto the mass hanger until you can move no more.</li>
  <li>Calculate the acceleration using the time measured, the distance between the two positions and the motion equations.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>The data shows a strong relationship between the external force applied onto the system and the acceleration the system. However, there are is a lot of room for improvement in our data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>human random error when stopwatch –&gt; precision</li>
  <li>human random error when letting go of trolley –&gt; precision</li>
  <li>systematic error due to friction –&gt; accuracy</li>
  <li>measurement error –&gt; precision</li>
  <li>validity all g</li>
  <li>errors –&gt; reliability
    <ul>
      <li>could have been more tested</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>systematic error due to persecptive –&gt; accuracy</li>
  <li>friction against side of track as random error –&gt; precision</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The hypothesis is supported by the data. The increase of external force on a system is proportional to the increase of acceleration of the system.</p>
