    <p>Quantity of heat is the quantity of heat from a reaction. It is calculated by:</p>

\[q=m\cdot C\cdot\Delta T\]

<p>Wth are these variables? Well q is quantity of heat, m is mass (g), C is heat capacity, and delta T is change in temperature. What is heat capacity? The amount of energy it takes for something to get this much hotter. So yeah.</p>

<p>Does that mean that heat and temperature arenâ€™t the same thing?</p>
