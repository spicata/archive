    <p><strong>Alkali</strong> metals (Group 1) are very soft, highly reactive, and make a highly alkaline solution when reacting with water.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> For alkalies, they become more reactive as you move down the group. <strong>Alkaline</strong> earth metals (Group 2), are also highly reactive, though not as much as alkalies. They also react with water to create an alkaline solution, and they are also more reactive the more down they are. <strong>Halogens</strong> (Group 17) are highly reactive, and they can react with metal to create salts. They are more reactive at the top. <strong>Noble</strong> gases (Group 18), are highly unreactive gases. <strong>Lathanides</strong> are rare-earth elements that are all radioactive. <strong>Transition</strong> metals are metals that are more reactive at the top (see also: [[Metals]]).</p>
