    <ul>
  <li>Waves are something that transfers energy.</li>
  <li>They can be classified two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanical and EMR</li>
      <li>Transverse and Longitudinal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mechanical and EMR depend on the medium through which they propagate.
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanical waves are waves that spread through particles ???</li>
      <li>EMR waves (electromagnetic radiation) spread ???</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transverse and longitudinal waves
    <ul>
      <li>Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles move in the direction of the wave.</li>
      <li>Transverse waves are waves where the particles move perpendicular to the direction of the wave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Essential wave properties:
    <ul>
      <li>Reflection: when a wave encounters a media boundary, some of the wave is reflected back (in accordance to the law of reflection).
        <ul>
          <li>The law of reflection: the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</li>
          <li>This is what creates echos</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Refraction: Waves, when they encounter a media boundary, bend away or towards the normal, if not reflected.</li>
      <li>Diffraction: Waves, when they encounter an obstacle that is equal to or smaller than the wavelength of the wave, ‘bend’ around said object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
