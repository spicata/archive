    <p>Let’s say you have a cube (1x1x1). Now you double all the sides, so it is 2x2x2. But then the surface area is quadrupled, and the volume is octupled. So volume becomes exponentially bigger (or smaller) than the surface area.</p>

<p>Now if a thing is small enough, things begin to become wacky, because the surface area to volume ratio becomes massive. We have now entered the realm of quantum mechanics. Things here don’t act they way we think it should.</p>
