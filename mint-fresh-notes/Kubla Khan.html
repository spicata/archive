    <p>We see the glorification of the [[Medieval Age (Romanticism)]], as well as the interest in non-western aspects of history/society/literally anything (<em>Kubla Khan</em> coming from Mongol Warlord Kublai Khan, and also talks about Abyssinian). There are also supernatural aspects tied to nature, both of which are common themes in [[Romanticism]], due to its rebellion from urban-rational landscapes. It also shows the grandness of nature, which we call the sublime.</p>

<p>Not related to romanticism, but <em>Kubla Khan</em> can be seen as aesthetic literature, as it wasnâ€™t really concerned with the meaning, but rather just how it sounded.</p>
