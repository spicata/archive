    <p>It’s that time of the month again. Time to write some letters! This time, I’ll cut straight to the chase. None of this “achieved” and “evaluate” and “design” rubbish. I’m just going to write some letters.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-letter">Monthly Letter</h1>

<p>Dear January 2023,</p>

<p>I just read November 2022 letter, and the amount of questions made me feel not good. But apart from that, I’m not too sure what to write, so I’ll just say… Don’t lose sight of what you think is important. Because to us, the important things are what matters.</p>

<p>Who cares what others think? What might be important for us might not be for them. We are all different after all. But variety is a two way street; what matters for the might not matter for us. Don’t let their own perceptions warp ours.</p>

<p>Our goal is to become the best that we can. Learn what we want. Help when we can. Who cares what Pranav thinks? Who cares what Edward thinks? They may just be looking out for us, but their own opinions influence that. Stand for what you think is right. It’s better than just being passive.</p>

<p>Learn Jekyll if you think it will be useful. Learn about studying if you think it will help you study. Learn about negotiating if you think it will make your relationships better.</p>

<p>Last month, I cared too much about what others thought. I think the letter emphasised that. I cared too much about what December me would think. And by doing so, the letter was sterile and safe. It felt impersonal and distant. That’s not what I want to achieve here. I want myself, and you, to go forwards with what I think is right. <strong>I</strong> want <strong>you</strong> to be bold, and have fun.</p>

<p>Life is about having a good time, and paving your own road. Call me an idealist, call me insane. But deep in your heart, your mind, you know I’m right.</p>

<p>Good luck,<br />
December 2022.</p>

<h1 id="yearly-letter">Yearly Letter</h1>

<p>Dear December 2023,</p>

<p>This is a letter that not many of us get to write. Maybe about only 60 people get to write this. I think it’s a big task, and so, I’ll try not to waste this opportunity, and I’ll try not to waste your time. Although… it doesn’t hurt to compare yourself from your past, so I think that if you cringe a bit, it’s a good indication you are better than me. Mistakes make life worth it, mistakes help us grow.</p>

<p>And I think that’ll be the message of this letter. You might think I’m naive, that I overjudged my capabilities, and that I’m too innocent. And it’s true, I’m oblivious to the real world. Childish, and foolish. But… well, who’s to say that that’s a bad thing? The “adult” world is cold, unfeeling, and systematic.</p>

<p>And yet, it fails, right? Things are as imperfect as always. This almost godly system that is praised by all, falters. I’m not sure if you’ll remember it, but I read <em>A Mathematician’s Lament</em> by Paul Lockhart yesterday. And I think that we’ve butchered much more than just math. The beauty of childhood is that they know that it isn’t perfect. There is no goal to having fun, we’re just enjoying the moment. It just feels right.</p>

<p>But adulthood means that you stop accepting that you aren’t perfect. Everything must have a goal now. If it doesn’t, it is a waste. But… why? Why must someone live like this? Why should anyone have to endure this torture, living a shell of a life, becoming a shell of a person. A child’s world is warm and bright, anything is possible as long as they try. They empathise and sympathise, they show emotion. They help others even if they are different. An adult’s world goes against all of this.</p>

<p>Oh yeah by the way, I’m listening to <em>Where Do I Belong</em> by Infected Mushroom right now, and I think it does an okay idea at setting the mood. Where does childishness <strong>belong</strong> into our modern world. Well sadly, it doesn’t really fit. Our world was built for cold productivity, at the expense of literally everything, not for us to live our best life. And all that does is lead us to chaos. To war and hunger.</p>

<p>But children don’t accept things for the way they are. They try and change it. They want to become anything and everything. They want to help everyone. Their friends, their parents. Have you seen children play at playgrounds? They casually ask each other for their names, and they respond. Strangers becomes friends, even if they never see each other again. They call each other what they want them to call them. Even if you tell children to not do something, they find ways to do it. They design innovate and novel ways to solve problems they face. They break rules, and question the status quo.</p>

<p>Adults become hardened by reality. They accept things for the way they are. They see strangers, and they know they will never see them again. Ignore them then, or even better, manipulate them. Why must someone live like this? It’s a miserable way of living. It must be agony. And yet, they don’t even try to change life. Even if it has a 1% chance of happening, or even a 10%. I bet even a 50% would struggle to change their mind.</p>

<p>And this is not the way I want to live. And I’m sure as hell this is not the way you want to live either. I want to live in a paradise. The children’s land.</p>

<p>And so… be childish. Be inefficient. Be rebellious. And be fun.</p>

<p>I truly mean this.<br />
