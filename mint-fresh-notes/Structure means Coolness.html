    <p>If a substance has strong bonds, it has a rigid structure. If it has a rigid structure, that means itâ€™s constituents move less. If they move less, more energy can be put into the system before they break out. Bonds means structure, structure means high melting and boiling points.</p>

<p>Ionic crystals have high melting points, and covalent networks have very high ones (see [[Crystals n Ionic Ones]] and [[Covalent Crystals]]). Covalent molecules have low melting points.</p>
