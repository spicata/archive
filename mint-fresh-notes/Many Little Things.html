    <p>This website obviously must have started somewhere. With a singular note (it was this one: [[1 - Indigenous Philosophies (L)]] made on the 27th of August, 2022). Is that many notes? No, of course not. But over time, I added one more note. Are two notes many notes? No. Are three notes many notes? Also no. But I continued to add more, and now I have 326 notes<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Is that a lot of notes? Maybe, maybe not. But I wouldn’t say it is a little amount of notes.</p>

<p>The question then is… when did the little amount of notes because a not little amount? This is what is known as the sorites paradox. When does a lot become a little, and vice versa? Something may seem small now, but then you look back, and say “damn, when did this happen” (see also: [[Things that Rot]]).</p>
