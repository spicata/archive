- progress as coming about through the struggle for power between different social classes
- The exploitation of one social class by another is seen especially in modern industrial capitalism
- result is alienation
    - worker is 'deskilled' and made to perform fragmented, repetitive tasks in a sequence of whose nature and purpose he or she has no overall grasp
    - i.e. alienated from the product and their purpose
- past: worker completed the whole production process
- workers are bereft of their full humanity and are thought of as 'hands' or 'the labour force'
- society constituted by a base and a superstructure
    - base: the material means of production, distribution, and exchange
    - superstructure: culture
- culture is formed by the economy and stuff
    - economic determinism
    - however good art has some freedom nonetheless
        - marx and engels enjoyed art
- deterministic: what people write are influenced by their culture. this culture is determined by their class.
    - the form is also a product of the culture within their class.
    - this would have help a lot for Kafka last year.

- division between the 'overt' (manifest or surface) and 'covert' (latent or hidden) content of a literary work
- context of a work to the social-class
- marx's approach was dialectical -> sees history progressing through conflict. a pattern of action and reaction.
- marxism is materialist (world = the physical stuff in it)
    - because of this, the world that people see and understand are dependent on the context (e.g. place, time)
    - marxism also sees a person's social class as one of these defining contexts.
        - e.g. a factory owner and a factory worker sees a factory as two different things.
- class relationships shapes history (the primary factor)
- difference in class => does the person own property or not.
    - in medieval europe: kings vs the serfs
    - in industrial europe: factory owners vs factory workers
    - in short, someone who controls the means of production.
- bourgeoisie and the proletariats (THE PROLES?!?!?)
- previously, progress was one bourgeoisie vs the other bourgeoisie.
    - new revolution -> proles vs burgers
- an egal society
