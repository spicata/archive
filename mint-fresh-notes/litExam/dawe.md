- Connotations of 'homecoming' (warmth, return to family, glory) harshly contrasts with the poem's representation of homecoming (dead boys returning to grieving families).
    - Almost a universal theme
- Repetition of "they're" showing the distance between those who dispose of the bodies and those who fight in the war; who are treated as a cannon fodder in the meat grinder that is war. The soldiers, people with emotion and dreams, with loving families to go back to, are merely disposed of by a war machine that does not care an ounce for it. The care it shows is superficial.
- What returns are not people, but bodies. This is made abundantly clear. They have no personality, no uniqueness. They are all stuffed into green bags, because to war, they are all the same. War does not care for the individual.
