- race is a social construction - culture beliefs
    - the majority can see itself as the norm, and those who are in the minority are marginalised. ingroup vs outgroup
- never 'neutral', texts carry attitudes (but this goes for anything right?)
- race as a justification of suppression/dispossesion
- alienation of minority writers
