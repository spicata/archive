A close reading is like an analysis on steroids. Not only do you have to make some meaning out of it, but also, you need to show why the hell the reader of your essay should care. Essentially, it boils down to two 'levels' that your essay exists in.

The first level: what can you find within the piece? What is objectively there. What information would any regular person be able to get from the thing. What symbolism, what metaphors, what 'stuff' is there.

The second level: how does it fit into Literature? What movements/genres are it a part of? How would different people analyse it?

A close reading is not only analysis the techniques used and forming a general theme. It is more about analysing the text *in a certain way*. Is it Feminist? Is it Marxist? What genre is it? What movements are it a part of? In close readings, you have to look at the bigger picture. How does this fit into what exists.

Or at least... that is how I understood it.
