The deliberate rebellion from traditional form of poetry and the experimental nature of this poem, as well as its personal stream of conciseness form is a reaction and rebellion from the 'traditional' poetic structures established by Western society, and by extension a rebellion from Western society as a whole. Additionally, the intentional misspelling of black could be seen as a refusal to conform to the role placed upon them, and as a formation of their own distinct and unique identity; a sense of self-determination.
