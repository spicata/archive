<p>Proton therapy’s biggest benefit over X-rays → higher precision i.e. less radiation exposure to nearby cells<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, seems to require an understanding in how X-rays are used in radiotherapy, research first!<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Radiotherapy uses radiation e.g. X-rays for medical therapy e.g. killing cancer. Does so by directing high-doses of radiation at cancer cells, which damages the DNA (mutates base pairs, breaks the backbone, breaks hydrogen bonds), preventing reproduction/causing apoptosis. Indiscriminate, will harm normal cells.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>PET is a type of scanning. Used w/ CT. The Wikipedia article is quite dandy.</p>

      <p>Sources don’t really seem to specify, but apparently due to fact that X-rays pass through the tumour, continuing to do damage. Protons don’t.</p>

      <p>Essentially, the protons can have an ending point specified. How it does this I don’t know. Also, of course it isn’t that specific (to degree of 1 cell). Might want to have a look at <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/proton-therapy-safety-versus-traditional-radiation">this link</a> <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Also, needs to be around the cyclotron. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Note always for cancer, also for killing … other tumours. Not very exciting. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
