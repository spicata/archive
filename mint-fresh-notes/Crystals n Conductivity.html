    <p>Crystals are cool, but most of them aren’t conductive. Solid ionic crystals (see [[Crystals n Ionic Ones]]) are not conductive. And that makes logical sense. They are bond together by charge. If the charge moves around, then they would not be solid. So a solid ionic crystal doesn’t conduct electricity. However, when it is melted down or dissolved in water, then they are now free to move around, so they can conduct electricity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!EXAMPLE] Do this experiment (if you can (most definitely a safety hazard considering how badly the steps are written) )</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dissolve salt (an ionic crystal) in water</li>
    <li>Get one of those electricity test things</li>
    <li>Test if the water is now conductive</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Covalent molecular structures and covalent networks structures usually don’t conduct. Except again, graphite. So yeah.</p>

<p>Also, there are metals. Metals conduct very well. Both heat and electricity, cause of their sea of electrons (see also [[Metals and Non-metals]]).</p>
