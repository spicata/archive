    <p>Nanomaterials are materials that are composed of structures that exist on the nanometre scale (see also: [[Materials]])<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Because the square-cube law is funny ([[Square-Cube Law is Funny]]), nanomaterials act weirdly. Ever seen a gecko? Know how they stick to stuff? Yeah, they have nanomaterial feet.</p>

<p>We can also make nanomaterials. A common one is fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes, and graphene. I donâ€™t know what they are used for yet ðŸ˜• .</p>
