    <p>Redox is confusing. Redox is an acronym for reduction-oxidation (the actual order is the other way around, but no-one says oxred). What does reduction mean? Reduction means to gain electrons. Oxidation means to lose electrons.</p>

<p>Guess what you call things that oxidises. YOU CALL THE REDUCTANT. YOU CALL THE THING THAT <em>OXIDISES</em> A <em>REDUCTANT</em>. YOU CALL THE THING THAT REDUCES AN OXIDANT. WHAT? WHY?! ðŸ˜¡</p>

<hr />

<p>This is the whatâ€™s confusing about redox reactions. A reductant oxidises, and an oxidant reduces.</p>
