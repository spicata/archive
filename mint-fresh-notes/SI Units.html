    <p>SI (metric) units<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are the internationally agreed upon units of measurement. Well almost… USA still uses freedom units<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. There are a variety of these units, measuring things like volume (litre), mass (kilograms), time (seconds). However, another similarity between all of these units mentioned above is that they are all fundamental units. They are defined by SI units. There are also derived units, which are based on other units. Like speed (metres divided by seconds) and acceleration (velocity divided by seconds).</p>
