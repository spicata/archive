here is my list on resources i use for chinese. sadly, they aren't as collective and organised as [jisho.org](https://www.jisho.org) (those lucky japanese learners), however there is still plentiful.

- [allset chinese](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese)
    
    this is just a great general resource for chinese. there are a plenty of vocab and grammar you can ~~steal~~ learn from here, it is simply wonderful. this ideas on free resources is also great, and i trust that they probably will stay free for a long time.

    also the comic strips are great.

- [train chinese](https://www.trainchinese.com/v2/index.php?rAp=0)

    for some god forsaken reason this website is associated with 'choo-choo' trains in my head, and not training. that is besides the point. this is essentially just a massive dictionary for chinese, that you can not only search up in english, pinyin, and chinese, but also there are phrases and example sentence, as well as stroke order. overall, 10/10 dictionary.

    also, there are things like flashcards and stuff you can use here, but i haven't used them yet, so no comment.

- [google translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=zh-CN&op=translate)

    google translate and the suite of other translating apps are okay at it's job. they are not quite perfect, so i would not rely on them solely for writing stuff, however, they can give you a general gist, and you can check if your sentence (in chinese) makes sense when you translate it to english. also, it is good to use as a quick, on the go dictionary essentially.

- [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

    if you somehow have the time to make anki flashcards and study them consistently, you could probably solve climate change instead. that is besides the point. anki is admittedly a pretty great way of just getting stuff inside of your head, with the caveat that it often takes up loads and loads of your time. if you want a consistent, high-investment high-return method, use anki, but it won't really work for all of us.

    to keep in mind when you use anki is that, first of all, clozes are very, very useful. the second tip is that, when you write the backside or whatever, include lots and lots of explanation if you have the time to write it. it is even better if you have that because you might forget entirely, and will have to relearn it.

    oh yeah, also, a microtip is that if you make your thing extremely funny, for example to show a grammar point, you wrote something like "i can take e huynh's bussy" (我会把edward的bussy拿了), you'll probably have an easier time remembering the grammar point or whatever it is.

- [purple culture talker](https://www.purpleculture.net/chinese-pinyin-converter/)

    i haven't explored much of purple culture, but ed introduced me to this tool, and told me to add it onto the resources.
