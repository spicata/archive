    <p>Covalent bonding is a form of chemical bonding that happens between non-metals, in which atoms share pairs of electrons with each other. If this occurs between two atoms (or more) of the same non-metal, then we have non-polar bonding, as the electronegativity of both atoms are equal. For example:</p>

<p>![[Oxygen.png]]</p>

<p>is a form of non-polar bonding, as the two oxygen atoms have the same electronegativity, thus sharing the electrons equally. What nice fellows. There are other times when it isn’t so nice. When the two atoms have different electronegativities, then the electron is more inclined to lean one way.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> For example:</p>

<p>![[Hydroxide.png]]</p>

<p>is a form of polar bonding. The electrons lean more towards the oxygen, and hence the oxygen is relatively negative, while the hydrogen is relatively positive.</p>
