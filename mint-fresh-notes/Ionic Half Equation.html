    <p>Ionic half equations is something that we use when dealing with redox reactions (see [[Redox]]) in chem. So let’s just see an example:</p>

\[2H^{+}+2e^{-}\rightleftharpoons H_{2}\]

<p>“Woah where did that come from?” Let’s have a see. This is the half equation for hydrogen gas. On the left side, we see two hydrogen ions and 2 free electrons. The two hydrogen ions are positively charged, and the 2 electrons are negatively charged. Okay then, they combine to form two hydrogen atoms. But, you know, hydrogen is like a halogen (see [[Hydrogen’s Friends]]), and so it make diatomic molecules. And so we get H2. Cool.</p>
