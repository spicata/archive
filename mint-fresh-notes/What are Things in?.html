    <p>I want to code stuff to help me. So I need to know what to learn to code. Should I learn Ruby, Javascript, C, Golang, etc? So to answer this questions, I have another question. What are things coded in?</p>

<h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>

<p>Ruby, RubyGems, Ruby on Rails, RVM, Bundle. What’s the difference? No clue. All of them do Ruby, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Jekyll (a static site generator) is coded in Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="golang">Golang</h2>

<p>Hugo is coded in Go. So is charm. Those are some cool programs.</p>

<h2 id="c">C</h2>

<p>C and C++ are apparently similar. C is also very powerful. Windows and Linux is coded in C. Mac is in something called Objective C. I’m going to assume it’s from the same family. Vim and Emacs is in C too.</p>

<h2 id="c-1">C#</h2>

<p>What the hell is the difference between C# and C? No clue.</p>

<h2 id="electron">Electron</h2>

<p>Electron is kind of just a framework. The real magic happens with typescript and javascript. Obsidian is an electron program coded in typescript. VS code is electron with typescript/javascript.</p>
