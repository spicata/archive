    <p>[[Contradiction Builds Character]], not only in the eyes of yourself, but also in the eyes of your opponent. Act in a way they wouldn’t expect, and they’ll reevaluate their perception of you. It can also lessen their fear of you (see also [[Acting in Fear]]), which is always good for both parties.</p>

<p>But what does acting contradictory mean? Well, do something unexpected. Give them a gift. Invite them to dinner. Do whatever. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
