    <p>Galvanic cells are electrochemical cells<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that produces electricity.</p>

<p>A is anode, B is anolyte, C is salt bridge, D is conductive stuff[^2], E is cathode, F is catholyte, G is oxidation half-cell, H is reduction half-cell.</p>

<p>The salt bridge and the conductive stuff complete the circuit. How? Well the conductive stuff, made of conductive stuff like metal, allows electrons to move from anode to cathode, while the salt bridge allows ions to move to anolyte and catholyte.</p>

      <p>I remembered what it was. Lo and behold, it was on my post it note. An electrochemical cell is a thing that turns chemical potential energy into electrical energy.</p>

      <p>Wait, if thatâ€™s what an electrochemical cell is, what is a galvanic cell?
