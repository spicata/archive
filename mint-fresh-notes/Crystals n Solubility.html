    <p>Ionic solids are sometimes soluble. To make sure, you should check the solubility rules. But why are they soluble? It’s because of ion-water dipoles. Water, as we have established, has dipoles (see [[Polars]] &amp; [[Covalent Bonding]]). So, ions can associate with water sometimes. This tends to happen if the ion-water dipole is stronger than the dipole-dipole bonds within that molecule, like in salt. And so, the ionic solid comes apart.</p>

<p>Covalent molecular substances and covalent network substances (again) are mostly insoluble. I’m starting to see a trend here ([[Crystals n Solubility]]).</p>
