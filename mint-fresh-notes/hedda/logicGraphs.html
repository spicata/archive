    <h2 id="hedda-wants-to-be-independent">Hedda wants to be independent</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Possibly as a result of her upper class upbringing as well as the freedom that she felt when she was with her father, Hedda wants to be independent (seen when she would ride around the town with the feather in her hair)</li>
  <li>On the other hand, she has become married to Jorgen Tesman.</li>
  <li>Due to her marriage, she has been somewhat forced into a more domestic lifestyle, where she needs to take care of Jorgen. However, it is not Jorgen who has locked her into this role, but rather the society as a whole.</li>
  <li>She was restricted by the societal contexts at her time:
    <ul>
      <li>Women were defined by the people they married and took care of. (e.g. Aunt Julle, who literally cannot go without finding another person to take care for).</li>
      <li>Their value was measured by their ability to take care of others.</li>
      <li>This was because women were predominantly caregivers. They had to be passive and dependent on men.</li>
      <li>The character of Hedda is, herself, a challenge to this belief.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not only that, but by being pregnant, she is even more forced into this role as a mother. Having a child would truly seal her in a relationship with Jorgen, and further diminish her independence.</li>
  <li>This is partly why she commits suicide by the end and also why she burns the book, as well as trying to take control over others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hedda-doesnt-like-being-poor">Hedda doesn’t like being poor</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Hedda marries to someone of a lower social class.</li>
  <li>This restricts her freedom, as it forces her to actually have to think about spending. She is no longer able to live her life of no worries anymore.</li>
  <li>Being rich has accustomed her to living a life of freedom.</li>
  <li>This is the reason that Hedda is so obsessed with her father’s pistols. It, and the piano, are the very last ties to her aristocratic past.
    <ul>
      <li>As seen in the first act however, she realises that the piano does not fit into her new house, and yet is unwilling to let it go. This is symbolic of her entire style of life. It contrasts harshly with her new reality, and yet she is unwilling to let go of it, and would rather drive herself into ground than to let it go.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>However, I don’t think that this is a criticism of the upper class nor is it a criticism of those of different socio-economic classes being together. Instead, it is a criticism of the way that those of lower economic classes (inherently) are afforded less liberties.</li>
  <li>Being poor is seen as a thing that restricts the people. In a sense, it does, and everyone is hunting for the reputation, wealth, or position to let them live a comfortable life.</li>
  <li>However, this life continues to elude those around it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hedda-is-too-clingy">Hedda is too clingy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Hedda clings to her past too much.</li>
