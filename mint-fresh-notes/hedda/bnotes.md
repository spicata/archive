# Henrik Ibsen:

- Very famous playwright (= dramatist)
- Norwegian 
- Father went bankrupt at an early age, apparently having a large influence on him.

## Hedda

- â€¦ liked manipulating people. (for some 'fun' (powerplay))
- The play itself is almost configured like a Greek tragedy.
    - The entire play occurs in a drawing/living room
    - Not too many people exist on the stage at once
    - Deaths are always shown offscreen.
- It also shows characteristics of a 'well-made play', which has 7 main points:
    1. Plot known to audience but not to the characters (dramatic irony)
    1. Increasingly more intensity and suspense.
    1. A series of ups and downs in the main character's fortunes
    1. Lowest and highest point both shown
    1. Central misunderstanding leads to conflict
    1. Logical and plausible denoument
    1. The overall structure is reflected in each act
- However, Ibsen did rebel against the well-made play format, and rather made his own.
- Hedda desires for freedom. Tesman prevents her from being fully independent.
- Difference in the traditional male and female's role
    - Men were seen as active, rational, providers, protectors of the home. Women were seen as passive, nurturing, moral. Hedda did not show any of these characteristics, she was a much more active character, and the world bent around her.
- The title *Hedda Gabler* uses Hedda's maiden name, apparently an attempt to emphasise that she is more her father's daughter rather than her husband's wife. i.e. She feels closer and aligns herself more with her father, the general, rather than her husband, for whom she seems to feel some contempt.
    - This may be because under her father, she would have more liberties, whereas under Tesman, she feels more entrapped.
    - The name Hedda also means *strife* --> her very existence is a little thorn in someone's side, enjoying the conflict she causes.
- The way that the piano does not fit into the rest of the house mirrors how Hedda does not see herself as belonging to the Tesman family, and yet her inability to dispose of it reflecting how she would not like to get rid of her old 'persona', her way of thinking.

## Realism

- Early Realists was a philosophical school opposed to 'Nominalists'.
    - Believed that there exists a true/perfect/absolute form of stuff (anything) that exists independently from objects.
- This way of thinking died down early 19th century
- 'let us replace sentimentalism by realism, and dare to uncover those simple and terrible laws which, be they seen or unseen, pervade and govern'.
- Realism tried to depict the *real* world as accurately and objectively as possible; showing how they truly exist. 
    - e.g. An interaction between characters feels and plays out like an actual interaction between people, and it isn't 'forced' to say.
- Realism is explaining the world objectively (?!), rather than being idealistic about it.
- In a word, lifelike.
- Tries to target things not covered as much, such as the lower classes.
- e.g. William Howells, Sinclair Lewis, HG Wells, Arthur Miller, etc.
- 'Revived' the English theatre.
- Does not try to 'reshape' the world in the text in any way, and rather shows it as it is. The characters within the play will change and grow, but the greater world which they live in stays essentially the same.
- Instead of looking to the rich and wealthy (usually), who had already been represented sufficiently in the literature, it looked towards the impoverished, as this was the way that the world was, and also because they were much less represented by other texts
    - This allowed them to not rely on what others had made which may have been sugarcoated.
    - It also revealed the 'truth' to the extent possible of lower-class society at the time, and removed all rose-tinted lenses when looking at society. It address the issues of the common people, created realistic, probable conflicts, and created well-rounded characters that seemed to exist not solely as characters but rather as people who have their own lives outside of the theatre.

## Naturalism

- naturalism is a more specific part of realism that goes late 19th century
- Studies the natural cause of things (disregarding supernatural and religious things)
    - Physical stuff you can interact with
    - What cannot be observed is not included, and it assumes that this is true.
- Darwin (again) and evolution can be seen as a method of natrual selection.
- hedda has some naturalistic aspects, but cannot be considered a naturalistic play (i think)
- Have a look at the 'natural world'. For reference, scientists are natural philosophers.
- Seen in opposition to supernaturalism (ghosts and things) or in the study of natural history i.e. biology.
- Emile Zola was the epitome of Naturalism.
- A very detailed form of realism, that looked at the role that the environment played in the creation of an individual. Influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, they looked at the hereditary and the environmental impacts on humanity.
- Determinism, objectivism, pessimism, surprising twist at the end
    - Determinism is the waiving of free will: everything led up to this moment, and so what I do at this moment is already pre-determined by all the factors (neuron activation, the photons that enters my eyes), and there is no other option that you could have possibly chosen.
    - Objectivism: the idea that the author is depicting the story objectively. By deattaching the narrator from the character, the author achieves a sense of objectivity.
    - Pessimism: Naturalist works exposed the 'dark underbelly of society' (borrowed from Jekyll and Hyde lol). It talked about otherwise objectionable subject matters, such as the inevitability of death, racism, discrimination amongst the classes.
        - Hedda seemingly glorifies a noble death, possibly as an influence of her late general father, as well as her bourgeoisie background that may have romanticised it.
        - Although death is a morbid topic, Hedda seems to have a general pessimism towards life, possibly due to her circumstance of having married someone from a lower status.
    - For the last point, it just emphasises that nature doesn't give a damn.
        - Hedda acts like a force of nature within the story.
        - Her actions don't seem to have any motivation behind them other than she is bored, and in the course of the story, ends up destroying several people's lives through the play.
        - The other characters are also forced to 'account' for her, as if she is some unchanging piece of nature, possibly on account of her high standing.
- Naturalism is a philosophy of writing (environment shapes the character), whilst Realism is a form of writing that values realism. It was scientific in nature, not subjective.
