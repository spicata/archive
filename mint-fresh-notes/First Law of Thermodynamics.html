    <p>Remember [[Mass &amp; Energy Conservation]]? No? Probably so. This is actually the first law of thermodynamics in action. In a closed system, the amount of energy is constant. But in an open system, if the [[Enthalpy]] goes down, then the enthalpy of the surroundings go up. Energy is conserved in the bigger system of the smaller system.</p>
