    <h2 id="reliability--validity--accuracy--precision">Reliability &amp; Validity &amp; Accuracy &amp; Precision</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reliability</strong> is when you can repeat an experiment and get the same results, which can be achieved by <em>repetition</em> and <em>replication</em>.</li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="validity-is-the-extent-to-which-the-tests-measure-what-was-intended-which-can-be-achieved-by-using-control-variables-and-control-groups"><strong>Validity</strong> is the extent to which the tests measure what was intended, which can be achieved by using <em>control variables</em> and <em>control groups</em>.</h2>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to its actual true value.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision</strong> is the closeness of measurements to each other.
    <h2 id="scientific-papers">Scientific Papers</h2>
    <p>Scientific papers come in the structure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>Background Information</li>
      <li>Aim</li>
      <li>Hypothesis</li>
      <li>Risk Assessment*</li>
      <li>Materials and Method</li>
      <li>Diagram</li>
      <li>Results</li>
      <li>Discussion</li>
      <li>Conclusion</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Huh, ten steps. How convenient.</em></p>
<h3 id="aim">Aim</h3>
<p>Show why you are doing a certain experiment. What is the goal? That’s what your aim is. It can be written in the structure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What happens to [dependent variable] when we change [independent variable]? This is to determine…</p>
  <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
  <p>The hypothesis is a <strong>statement</strong> predicting what will happen. It can be written in an “if, then” statement, such as:
If [independent variable] [increases/decrease], then [dependent variable] [increases/decreases]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When writing a hypothesis, do not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use “amount”, instead opt to use the word: “number/concentration/mass/ecetera”; and</li>
  <li>Do not use “because”, you do not need to explain.
    <h3 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h3>
    <p>As for the materials, simply list all of them, however, still be specific. If you used a 500ml beaker, write “500ml beaker” instead of “beaker”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Method should be clear enough so that another person should be able to replicate your experiment. Use a numbered or bullet point list, and write in a passive past-tense voice. Do not say “I”, science doesn’t care about the “I”.</p>
<h3 id="graphing-rules">Graphing Rules</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Independent</strong> variable → <em>x-axis</em> <br /> <strong>Dependent</strong> variable → <em>y-axis</em></li>
  <li>Choose type of <strong>graph</strong></li>
  <li>Give your graph a <strong>title</strong> (effect of independent on dependent)</li>
  <li>Determine <strong>range</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Label</strong> each axis</li>
  <li>Plot with <strong>small dots</strong></li>
  <li>Use sharp pencil and ruler</li>
  <li>Use more than <strong>half the space</strong></li>
  <li>Use a <strong>key</strong>
    <h3 id="results">Results</h3>
    <p>You write your observations here. They can be qualitative or quantitate. Use tables here.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Describe trends and patterns in your results, and support it with evidence, and refer to your background information here.</p>

<p>You can also state the limitations of the study. Being disorganised is not a limitation of the study. It’s a limitation of you. Not having resources is a limitation. Also propose a way to overcome these limitations.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Were you right? Does your experiment support or disprove your hypothesis? Describe your findings, and refer to evidence.</p>
