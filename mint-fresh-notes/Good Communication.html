    <p>Humans mangle words. Sadly, it is the truth. And so, we must be extra careful when talking to humans. Be attentive, don’t be vapid, don’t talk for vanity, and try not to misunderstand (see also [[It’s all Humans]]).</p>

<p>Listen carefully, and you’ll understand them. Ask, and you’ll get across that you are listening, and allows you to iron out any confusions. This will help you understand, and it’ll make them want to understand you too. Don’t worry about agreeing; you can understand and disagree all the same.</p>
