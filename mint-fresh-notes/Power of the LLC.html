    <p>Language can let us weave stories. Using stories we can convey ideas. And with ideas, anything is possible. Google is fundamentally an idea. If the headquarters disappears one day, Google the company will still exist. If the CEO just died suddenly, Google the company will still exist. You can’t “kill” Google. Google is a separate entity that we believe exists, but doesn’t really. Point at Google the company.</p>

<p>If at least one person believes in it, doesn’t that mean it exists? And these stories are a type of “fiction”, but they aren’t lies. Google doesn’t physically exist, but I would be wrong if I said that Google is lying about its existence.</p>
