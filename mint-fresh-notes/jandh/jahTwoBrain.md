- rsl might have been influenced by some scientific journals at the time exploring the idea the possibility of more than two 'consciousnesses' in the human brain.
    - Victorian age was a time of rapid scientific growth, and this stuff would have been novel and interesting.
    - The two sides of Jekyll and Hyde could be in reference to the two hemispheres of the brain and how they operate differently, but are also conscious of each other's existence.

    - Jekyll was rational (left-hemisphere), whereas Hyde was more emotional (right-hem).
    - Also tied into Queer reading, in that humans are inherently bisexual, and that one gender is repressed, and the other one is dominant. 
- This double brain also ties into Freud's conscious and unconscious. The potion just brings the other one into the dominant position.
- Jekyll is seen as the best result of evolution, while Hyde is more atavistic, a backwards primitive version of humanity.

- Idea that the hemi's could work independently.
- Insanity was seen as possible caused by an imbalance between these two hemispheres. In Jekyll's case, overusing the Hyde side made him stronger.
