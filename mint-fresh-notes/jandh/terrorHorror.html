      <ul>
  <li>Ann Radcliffe argued that terror and horror, albeit similar, are actually two different emotions.</li>
  <li>Horror is a visceral gut-wrenching feeling, where you are shown the danger. It purges your thoughts and makes you act on a fight-flight basis. It happens in response to something gruesome, such as seeing your friend get eaten by Edward. It makes you dead.</li>
  <li>Terror on the other hand makes you feel more alive. It is the feeling of knowing something around the corner but not knowing what it is; the idea of dread. Instead of acting on a physical response, it is imaginative. Nothing actually happens, just circumstance.</li>
