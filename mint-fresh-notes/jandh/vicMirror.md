- 'Duplicity of life' : the idea that a person shows one thing and is actually another
- This was the standard in Victorian society
- Some context...
    - In Victorian society, reputation and public image was incredibly important, and the quality of being 'austere'

        > austere : severe or strict in manner or attitude. (word of all time)

    - As a result of this, most people would hyde their inner desires that were looked down upon by society, such as things like emotions and other thinks.
- This is similar to Jekyll's own plight, as his problem is the disparity between his "imperious desire to carry [his] head high" and his "pleasures". This conflict is the primary conflict in the book. This is the conflict between Jekyll and Hyde.
- Also, this mirrors the plights of the Victorian person as well.
- This was kind of a trend in the Gothic movement, where the characters within the text would mirror aspects of the audience, and play with them.
- Utterson and Lanyon is the typical Victorian citizen. They respect the rigidity of Victorian society, and they don't try to change these boundaries. Utterson and Ensign try not to interfere with other's lives, their private life is their responsibility; again tying into the austerity stuff.
- However, Jekyll is the opposite, he is the imagination of the private life. He ponders what it would be like to split the public from the private forever; the good from the evil. It is eventually this idea that leads to his downfall.
    - As Jekyll continues to treat Hyde as his 'private life', he 'becomes' Hyde, as that is a truer depiction of who he is, and Jekyll falls into the background as a mere shell for Hyde.
