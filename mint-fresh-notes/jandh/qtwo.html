  <p>How does your awareness of a specific context help you to understand the issues and values presented in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Victorian context is the context</li>
  <li>Separation of the public and private life : the separation of the public and the private life in inherently problematic and creates problems that otherwise would not exist.</li>

  <li>The rigid dichotomies existent in Victorian society : The rigid dichotomies of good and evil have their flaws, and it fails to account for the ‘grey areas’ of life.</li>
  <li>Understanding the social landscape at the time allows us to realise what parts of Victorian society the text was challenging or endorsing — challenging the rigid dichotomies present in Victorian society and the separation of the public and private lives, as well as endorsing a healthy skepticism in both the sciences and the spiritual — and also gives insight into the development of the ideas present in the text</li>
