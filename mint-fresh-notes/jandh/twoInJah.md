- jah is (obviously) very involved in the idea of the duality of humanity. The character that exemplifies this is Dr Jekyll. On the outside, he is an upstanding and revered member of society, but he secretly has the desires to commit (and he eventually does) to indulge in his 'hidden desires'.
- The text also places many opposing (and even conflicting) ideas in close proximity, such as the idea of good and bad, honesty and duplicity, truth and lies, indulgence and restraint. This gives the impression that they actually exist in unison.

- Jekyll lives a double life. The front of his estate is highly decorated and well kept, whilst the back of his house is falling into disrepair (manufactured settings reflect the inner plights of those living within them). This layout could have easily been inspired by the events of Dr John Hunter, who became a notorious surgeon for buying (tons of) corpses off of grave robbers. This is similar to Jekyll, who outwardly was a very upstanding citizen, but actually goes around committing crimes.
