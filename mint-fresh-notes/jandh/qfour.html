  <p>Through close discussion of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, analyse the ways in which language can be a tool for offering particular representations of individuals, groups or ideas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Context is context</li>
  <li>Typical Victorian bourgeoisie : Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a representation of the Victorian bourgeoisie, whose reputation is incredibly important thus feeling the most pressure to conform to the societies rules and regulations, as they have the most to lose out on.
    <ul>
      <li>Dr Jekyll eventually cracks under this pressure, causing him to redirect his live’s work into splitting what he believes are the undesirable aspects of him, which inevitably leads to his downfall</li>
      <li>Could be commentary on how the rich and wealthy are so dispositioned to maintaining their status and so will do anything in their ability to keep it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Utterson and Ensign are just the typical Victorian citizen. They are nothing wealthy, and they keep their thoughts to themselves mostly. They would rather let others do themselves then get involved. This could be rls’s saying that being a bystander is best.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Works of fiction can act as a medium for an author to propagate their own, unique worldview.</li>
  <li>Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish author, famous for his works, such as <em>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em> and <em>Treasure Island</em>, and he grew up during the Victorian era.</li>
  <li>It was a time of great innovation and development, particularly for the British Empire, but it was also signified by strict, conservative societal structures.</li>
  <li>Within <em>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em> is a tool that offers representations of the average Victorian citizen through the characters of Dr Jekyll, Mr Hyde, and Mr Utterson.
