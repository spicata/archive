> Discuss how characterisation is used to represent ideas about social attitudes and values.

- Characterisation of Utterson - Utterson is seen as a model Victorian citizen, who is austere --- repressing his inner desires to uphold an image --- and does not want to get involved within other people's dramas.
    - Repression of desires and control over one's self.
- Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde - Jekyll is seen as the pinnacle of human society, but secretly is plagued by desires on the inside. However, he represses it in order to seem good. On the other hand, Mr Hyde, who was revealed by Jekyll's potion, is irrational, primitive, and constantly anger or sad or something. He does not display the characteristics of Victorian people.
    - Jekyll could show rls' attitude to the repression of desires.
    - Hyde is a depiction of the fear of atavism.
