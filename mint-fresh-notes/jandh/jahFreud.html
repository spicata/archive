      <ul>
  <li>Freud posited that the human brain is split into 3 different ‘entities’ : id, ego, superego.
    <ul>
      <li>Id controls the primitive part of our brain, with disregard for society’s rules. It acts on impulse and desires, and it is this that Victorian society so vehemently despised and repressed.</li>
      <li>Superego is the morality of the human brain. It looks at society’s rules and follows them, and it does the ‘right thing’. If others benefit, even if i suffer a bit, it is for the greatest good.</li>
      <li>Ego is the mediator between the id and the superego. It is actually ‘us’, and is the part that makes the calls.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hyde can be seen as the manifestation of the id of Jekyll. He knows that what he does is not immoral, but he doesn’t really care.</li>
  <li>Jekyll is a combination of both superego and ego, but as he goes on, he increasingly fails to control Hyde.</li>
  <li>Another thing in psychoanalysis is the idea of defences and core issues. Jekyll was fundamentally afraid of this ‘id’ and the idea that people might eventually come to know of it, and so he attempts (in a mad frenzy) to separate himself from his blight, but in doing so, ends up only causing the end of himself, as his main defence against this entity (status) is shaken, Hyde grows more uncontrollable, and the previously closely monitored Hyde breaks free of his boundaries and 1) tramples a girl and 2) tramples an old man.</li>
  <li>Also, there is a recurring theme of dreams, with Utterson thinking about Hyde (and failing) “even in his dreams”, and Jekyll awaking from his dreams and Hyde.</li>
