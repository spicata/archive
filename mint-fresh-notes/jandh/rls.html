      <ul>
  <li>Born in Edinburgh (1818)</li>
  <li>Parents were engineers</li>
  <li>Father was sympathetic to his passion of writing
    <ul>
      <li>This was because he too wanted to be a writer but his own father stopped him, and instead became an engineer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Parents were devout Christians (Presbyterianism)
    <ul>
      <li>Only believes in God and the goodness of the Bible</li>
      <li>This had a pretty big effect on rls, although he did do a complete 180.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>rls moved away from Christianity
    <ul>
      <li>He doesn’t denounce it, but doesn’t 100% believe it</li>
      <li>He still thinks it is good as a way of living.</li>
      <li>I guess this is kind of reflected by Lanyon’s ‘revelation’, in which he starts saying God only after seeing Hyde’s transformation into Jekyll.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Didn’t study engineering, but compromised and studied law, even though he didn’t apply this.</li>
  <li>He married Fanny
    <ul>
      <li>She would tell him that Jekyll and Hyde was ‘eh’, which would lead him to throw the entire thing into the fire, and then restarted, becoming the modern enough rendition of jah.</li>
      <li>What is up with author’s always getting married to married people?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>He started with more romantic texts, but then transitioned to more dark (and realistic) texts later.</li>
  <li>Jah started as jsl’s nightmare
    <ul>
      <li>[pofound][] says that this and <em>Treasure Island</em> both explore the blurred borders between good and bad.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>rls was a pretty sick guy, and would spend most of his time bed-ridden.
    <ul>
      <li>He missed a long period of school because of this, but this would (clearly) not hamper his fame.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>rls’s father also was skeptical of the value of formal education.</li>
  <li>However, rls was a pretty interesting fellow (according to wikipedia: a ‘bohemian’)
    <ul>
      <li>He would also visit brothels</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Treasure Island was a massive success (bam).</li>
  <li>rls was a chad. He wrote the first revision of jah in 3 days, then did it all again in another 3 days.</li>
  <li>Money &lt; goodness</li>
  <li>Almost died meeting Fanny</li>
</ul>
