      <ul>
  <li>With the beginning of Victorian age came new ideas in science, one of which being Darwin’s theory of evolution.</li>
  <li>This created the question that, if it is possible that humans evolved from monkeys, is it possible for them to devolve back into monkeys, or any more primal humans.
    <ul>
      <li>This expression of more primal characteristics is known as atavism</li>
      <li>It is also sometimes just racism.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Throughout jah, Hyde is often described as “troglodytic” and “hardly human”, which dehumanises him and ties into this idea that Hyde is a more primitive reflection of Jekyll, a culmination of all his primal desires and urges.</li>
  <li>He is uncontrolled by society, and he just does whatever.</li>
</ul>
