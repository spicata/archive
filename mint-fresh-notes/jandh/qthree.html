  <p>Discuss how your understanding of generic conventions has shaped your understanding of <em>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>jah doesn’t fit as well into Gothic as with most other texts, as it was created in near the late end of the influence Gothic literature. It is also often called not a Gothic text, as it does not show much of the generic conventions, and it is more involved with the ‘mystery’, but more so on the question of the duality of humanity. Despite this, it does show some conventions.</li>
  <li>The weather is not great : This could tie into the industrialisation and the pollution caused by it that occurred during the Victorian age. However, it could also be used as a dramatic feature as well as pathetic fallacy as it reflects the obscurity and the mystery of Jekyll and Hyde, and the mist only dissipates once the mystery solved.</li>
  <li>The story is itself a mystery, but most of the audience will know how this story ends, as Jekyll and Hyde is such a widespread and known idea. Although it is a mystery, it does not fully fit into the ideas of mystery.</li>
  <li>It is hard to talk in terms of ‘the inner beast’ in the case of jah, as it is this piece that shaped this trope.</li>
