- The conflict between the sciences and the supernaturals : as neither science nor spirituality cannot accurately explain all phenomena, it should not be depended on to single-handedly shape our perspective.
- The rigid dichotomies existent in Victorian society : The rigid dichotomies of good and evil have their flaws, and it fails to account for the 'grey areas' of life.
- Understanding the social landscape at the time allows us to realise what parts of Victorian society the text was challenging or endorsing --- challenging the rigid dichotomies present in Victorian society and the separation of the public and private lives, as well as endorsing a healthy skepticism in both the sciences and the spiritual --- and also gives insight into the development of the ideas present in the text
