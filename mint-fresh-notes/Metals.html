Otherwise, they are often found as ores. These are called minerals. Metals on their own are sure as hell useful, but they can become even more useful when they are alloyed. An alloy is a (metallic) mixture of two or more metals<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (see also: [[Mixtures]]).</p>
