<ul>
  <li>We just practised</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="03th-of-february-2023">03th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Practised more, Lucarelli Chem Set 2 and 5.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="07th-of-february-2023">07th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We did a pre-test :-O. I guess we’ll see results next time around.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8th-of-february-2023">8th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Today was a very content heavy lesson.</li>
  <li>We did [[History of the Atom]]. I dislike history but :-/.
    <ul>
      <li>I’ll run through it briefly. Some ancient Greeks guessed that there are indivisible particles that make everything. They called this the atomos.</li>
      <li>[[John Dalton]] found the atom.</li>
      <li>[[JJ Thomson]] found the electron.</li>
      <li>[[Ernest Rutherford]] found the nucleus and the proton.</li>
      <li>[[Niels Bohr]] made the planetary model.</li>
      <li>Heisenberg made the quantum model, which is based on probability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modern science, unlike ancient philosophy, has the special quality of standing on the shoulders of giants.</li>
  <li>Atoms are “the basic building blocks of matter”</li>
  <li>We looked at [[Atomic Forces]].</li>
  <li>Why don’t electrons suicide into the nucleus? Well some funky quantum stuff.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9th-of-february-2023">9th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewed [[History of the Atom]].</li>
  <li>Looked at the structure of the atom.</li>
  <li>Atomic (proton) number is Z, and mass number is A.</li>
  <li>Isotopes are atoms of the same elements that have different numbers of neutrons, meaning that their A is different. Think the difference between carbon-12 and carbon-13 (and carbon-14).</li>
  <li>Isotopes have different physical properties.</li>
  <li>Looked into [[Mass Spectrometer]]s.</li>
  <li>This shows you what is in a sample.</li>
  <li>To practice, check the PPT.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10th-of-february-2023">10th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Empty class at start :-/</li>
  <li>STAWA Sets 8 and 21 is what we did. As <strong>homework</strong> I shall mark.</li>
  <li>That’s it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="14th-of-february-2023">14th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Homework: STAWA Set 23 and (i think) 26</li>
  <li>Balancing equations: law of conservation of mass at work.</li>
  <li>Stoichiometry</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="15th-of-february-2023">15th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Homework:</li>
  <li>Planck (1900) thought that</li>
  <li>Ionisation energy is the amount of nrg to remove ions</li>
</ul>

\[M_{(g)}\to M^{+}_{(g)}+e^{-}_{(g)}\]

<ul>
  <li>First ionisation energy
    <ul>
      <li>It’s harder to take away more (and more) electrons.</li>
      <li>As [[Atomic Radius]] goes up, ionisation energy goes down
        <ul>
          <li>Larger atoms break easier.</li>
          <li>But atoms to the right break harder</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Octets are the hardest to break.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sub-shells/levels: spdf
    <ul>
      <li>2 per orbital</li>
      <li>1 orbital in s’s, 3 orbitals in p’s, 5 orbitals in d’s, 7 orbitals in f’s.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 4d 4f is the order. 4s is easier to fill than 3d.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
