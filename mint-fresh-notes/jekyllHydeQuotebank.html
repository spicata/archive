    <h2 id="story-of-the-door">Story of the Door</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.”</p>

    <p>Juxtaposition of concepts and imagery. “cold, backwards in sentiment, dusty” but “yet somehow lovable”. This could show the contrast of public and private lives. Utterson seems a (well… dead on the inside), but he is actually good.</p>

    <p>The visual imagery also helps set up the character of Utterson, who is not the perfect protagonist, and yet the audience is positioned to like him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“‘I incline to Cain’s heresy,’” {said by Utterson}</p>

    <p>Cain’s heresy here is a biblical allusion to the story of Cain and Abel. This is specifically referring to Cain’s dialogue “Am I my brother’s keeper?”, showing how Utterson would rather stay away and see someone run themselves into the ground than getting involved in it. He really doesn’t care. This happened all the way to the case of Jekyll and Hyde, where he broke this rule and got involved, to pretty bad results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It wasn’t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut.” {said by Enfield}</p>

    <p>A Juggernaut is a “a huge, powerful, and overwhelming force”, seeing as how Hyde simply walked through that girl instead of stopping, unimpeded. It was derived from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut">Jagannath</a>, which is a diety worshipped in India; Juggernaut itself refers to a vehicle carrying a model of Jagannath.</p>

    <p>Also, the diction used, specifically “it” dehumanises Hyde, and likens him to a sort of object or animal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“with a kind of black, sneering coolness … really like Satan” {said by Enfield}</p>

    <p>Likens Hyde to Satan. Yet another biblical reference. The result is clear enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one … There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below.”</p>

    <p>Not entirely sure technique. House is given a sense of mystery. The lack of windows gives the impression of possibly some criminal activity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="search-for-mr-hyde">Search for Mr Hyde</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“would have estranged Damon and Pythias” {bL}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved”</p>

    <p>Draws parallels between Utterson (right now) and Jekyll a while back</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“even in his dreams”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“‘If he be Mr. Hyde,’ he had thought, ‘I shall be Mr. Seek.’”</p>

    <p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say?”</p>

    <p>Darwinism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="carew-murder-case">Carew Murder Case</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“ape-like fury”</p>

    <p>continuing on.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remarkable-incident-of-dr-lanyon">Remarkable Incident of Dr Lanyon</h2>

<ul>
  <li>“It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-last-night">The Last Night</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat”</p>

    <p>Pathetic fallacy is used here to highlight the incoming calamity of Dr Jekyll, as well as the destruction of Utterson’s peace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“masked thing like a monkey”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="henry-jekylls-full-statement-of-the-case">Henry Jekyll’s Full Statement of the Case</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“I concealed my pleasures” {by Jekyll}</p>

    <p>Context: ties in heavily to the Victorian context of concealing your  private life and instead only displaying your public life. Jekyll only showed the good parts of him to society. Also can be tied into the Gothic movement, whose characters would reflect the inner plights of the audience to an extent. The Victorian would seem to be earnest (not really).</p>

    <p>Also can be seen as Freudian psychoanalysis. Henry Jekyll is the ego, keeping his superego and his id in check. Hyde is the id, giving into primal desires and acting on impulse, a culmination of all of Jekyll’s repressed desires.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point.” {by Jekyll}</p>

    <p>Repetition? Parallelism? I don’t know what you call it, but it’s obviously drawing a contrast, and could show the idea of conflict between preconceived ideas and new ideas, such as was the case in society during that time, especially with science and stuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature.” {by J}</p>

    <p>The smaller Hyde was a part of a larger Jekyll, but also younger and lighter, unburdened by the pestering of the other guy (unlike Jekyll), and his ideas not fully developed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture” {bJ}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty” {bJ}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals” {bJ}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Jekyll had more than a father’s interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference”</p>
  </li>
</ul>
