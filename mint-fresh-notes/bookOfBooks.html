<ul>
  <li>We shared romanticism notes.</li>
  <li>Movements are an indication in the shift of attitude of the public. Most reactions come about from “status quo &gt;:-(“</li>
  <li>We analysed <em>[[London]]</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="07th-of-february-2023">07th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is London about?</li>
  <li>Literature is all about readings. These are your own interpretations.</li>
  <li>Topic sentences should be topic-led.
    <ul>
      <li>How about instead of the TEEL structure, we use the PETAL structure (point, evidence, techniques, analysis, link).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We wrote a short reading on London. And… uh… honestly I think I did pretty terrible. It was hot garbage. I don’t have high expectations :-/.</li>
  <li>We also looked at Daffodils.</li>
  <li>Here are some poetic devices:
    <ul>
      <li>Enjambment, when we don’t finish a line in a poem with a full stop.</li>
      <li>Caesura, when we break a line in the middle with a break (- or : or .)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enjambment and caesura can work together for even more emphasis.</li>
  <li>Romanticism is also kind of about exploration of self.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8th-of-february-2023">8th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We read <em>[[Daffodils]]</em>.</li>
  <li>To analyse texts, you need:
    <ul>
      <li>your own interpretation</li>
      <li>to figure out who is the persona</li>
      <li>find the tone, as it shows emotions which reveals the author’s values and attitude, and establishes mood.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The title of a poem plays a significant part in the meaning of the poem.</li>
  <li>Coney jumped</li>
  <li>Zoomorphism is giving animal qualities to humans. Anthropomorphism is giving human qualities to animals.</li>
  <li>The structure found in <em>Daffodils</em> is a simplified version of the Shakespearean sonnet. It sounds cool, but is also accessible. Nice.</li>
  <li>Coney jumped</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9th-of-february-2023">9th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We continued doing <em>[[Daffodils]]</em>.</li>
  <li>We made teams for the oral presentation.
    <ul>
      <li>Hm. Edward’s insulting me in Literature in the lead up to the oral presentation. This is either because:
        <ul>
          <li>He is not a nice guy, but I doubt this is true,</li>
          <li>He is aggravating me so that I study harder for Literature. It worked.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="15th-of-february-2023">15th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Homework:</li>
  <li>Romantics didn’t like “truths”. How do we know they are real?</li>
  <li>We aren’t made to fit into an artificial system.</li>
  <li>Society is artifice, we aren’t real with ourselves.</li>
  <li>Children are untainted by society.</li>
  <li>We are all impacted by [[Romanticism]].</li>
