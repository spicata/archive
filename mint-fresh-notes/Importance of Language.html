    <p>Language is a pretty crucial part of human life. Not only for nowadays, but also for the past. Our caveman ancestors relied on language. Humans are not very strong, or fast, or very special for anything else. But we can speak, and we can think. Through words, we were able to create stories. Stories are crucial as a means of transferring information (see: [[Stories and Knowledge Draft 2]]), but stories can also bind people together.</p>

<p>Random Christians can meet at church, and get along based on their belief of the Bible. Citizens of a country can come together based on their pride in the story of their country. People come together because of similarities in the story of their lives. Using stories, we were able to cooperate with people who we arenâ€™t very close to.</p>
