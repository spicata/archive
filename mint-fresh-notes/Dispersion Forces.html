    <p>Dispersion forces. Considering that to disperse means to spread out, then dispersion forces repel particles from each other right? <strong>WRONG</strong>. That would be too easy. Dispersion forces attracted non-polar particles? How? By temporarily giving them dipoles due to the fluctuation in electron density. Unsurprisingly, this is not that effective (they are weak).</p>

<p>Oops, sorry about that Ed. Hmm. I think it has something to do with Van der Waal‚Äôs forces or London forces or something. Not sure though.ü§î</p>
