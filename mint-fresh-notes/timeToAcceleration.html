    <p>you measured the time it took for the trolley to move. but how do we turn that into acceleration? well it’s pretty easy.</p>

<p>first you want to apply the motion equations. specifically the “s = ut + 0.5at^2”. we can rearrange this to get a = (s + ut) / (0.5t^2).</p>

<p>as we measured time, we just substitute that it. the initial velocity is obviously 0 (unless you botched your experiment). and s is just the distance that the trolley measured. for us, it was 0.69 metres but for you it might be different. sub all that in and you get acceleration (in m per s per s).</p>

<p>now we need to get the error of the measurements. so you just get to percentage uncertainty of s and t. then you add the them (s + t + t because t is squared).</p>
