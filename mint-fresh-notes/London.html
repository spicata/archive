    <p>I wander thro’ each charter’d street,<br />
Near where the charter’d Thames does flow. <br />
And mark in every face I meet<br />
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.</p>

<p>In every cry of every Man,<br />
In every Infants cry of fear,<br />
In every voice: in every ban,<br />
The mind-forg’d manacles I hear </p>

<p>How the Chimney-sweepers cry<br />
Every blackning Church appalls, <br />
And the hapless Soldier’s sigh<br />
Runs in blood down Palace walls </p>

<p>But most thro’ midnight streets I hear<br />
How the youthful Harlots curse<br />
Blasts the new-born Infants tear <br />
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse</p>

<p><em>London</em> is a criticism of the urbanisation that romantic poets faced during their age. Instead of a world of nature, Romantics found themselves within a world of science and technology. This quick urbanisation and industrialisation did not allow humanity itself to catch up, and they found themselves in times of poverty, bad living standards, and pollution. The wealthy was able to accrue more and more wealth, as the poor got poorer. “The hapless soldier’s sigh runs in blood down palace walls” personifies the last remnants of humanity in these cities, as soldiers and workers are left behind by the system that powers the “palace”.</p>

<p>Further, we can see the mourning of the lost of innocence and true emotion amidst this new environment. “Every voice” is shackled by “mind-forg’d manacles”, symbolic of the general public has tricked themselves into limiting their true imagination and feelings through science and technology. Furthermore, the “youthful Harlots curse” as “the Marriage hearse”, which shows the degradation of the legitimacy of the ‘institution’ of love and marriage. As prostitution proliferates in the city, the notion of love, an emotion closely to Romanticism, is damaged.</p>

<p>To add to this, the Industrial revolution signified a cultural change within society, as the public grew more adoptive of science and fell further from spirituality. Romanticism commonly explored these ideas of mysticism and the supernatural, and romantics expressed doubts over science, which can again be seen in <em>London</em>. “Every blackning Church appals” can be seen as literally depicting the impact of pollution on building in London, but it can be seen as the corruption and the delegitimisation of religion and <em>the unknown</em>’s role in society.</p>
