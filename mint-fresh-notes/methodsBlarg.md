combinatorics focuses on two things: combinations and permutations. lettuce start with permutations. permutations are different ways that you can arrange a collection of things. for example, different permutations of the numbers {1, 2, 3} include 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321. the equation for finding the number of permutations is:

$$^nP_r=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$

where n is the number of things there are in total, and r is the number of thing we are choosing from them. the exclamation mark here is a
