    <p>In general, good mood has little benefit for studying, however, bad mood is very bad. Simply having a good mood is not enough to learn well. You need to be able to utilise that mood to find intrinsic value and study well ([[Intrinsic Value]]). Bad mood impacts you greatly. Stress can release cortisol, which messes with your memory. Mood is only one of the parts of things that affect your study.</p>
