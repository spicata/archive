    <p>Dear February 2023,</p>

<ul>
  <li>IM25 - Infected Mushroom</li>
  <li>Looking Forward to Looking Back - Cinders</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey there future me! It’s that time to listen to what past you thought. And some months, we change a lot. Other times, we don’t. So the amount you agree and disagree will be influenced by what happens in February.</p>

<p>If things are continuing the way they are going now, I hope you had a great time. And if they didn’t continue, well I still hope you enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The first thing I want to talk to you about is:</p>

<h2 id="a-land-of-no-wrong-ways">A Land of No Wrong Ways</h2>

<p>We live in a world hidden by the fog of the future. Who knows how the future will pan out? I definitely don’t know for sure. All I can do is guess for now. Maybe I’ll get some more info down the road.</p>

<p>But just cause we don’t know what to do doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t do anything. We now the general direction of stuff. “Oh, that looks cool! I want to go that way.” We won’t 100% be sure where exactly we are going, but we can hope that we are coming closer to what we want.</p>

<p>There will be obstacles in the way. Ourselves, others, the world, anything. But just ‘cause there is, should we stop? And if we arrive at our goal and it wasn’t quite what we expected? Note it down. Leave it for others to decide if they want to come here or not.</p>

<p>On the way, we might meet someone on the way. No, we’ll meet many. They will all have their own goals, their own direction. Some you may decide have the wrong goals. So what? It’s theirs, not yours.</p>

<p>Other times, you might see people who inspire you or who agree with you. Then go along together! It’s a lonely road, but there’s no reason to travel it alone. And eventually, you and your new friend may find a diverging path. Then go the way you want, and tell your friend to go the way they want too. Just because you were together, doesn’t mean you have to be together forever.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, you’ll find someone lost. Just randomly wandering. And if you find someone like them, be the person who inspired you. Inspire them. Set them on a journey they’ll enjoy. And maybe they’ll see you again in the far future.</p>

<hr />

<p>Our lives for ourselves aren’t defined by where we reach, but how we get there. Others may only see the goal, but you know the journey. That’s the most important bit. Let’s not forgetting</p>

<h3 id="laying-paths">Laying Paths</h3>

<p>Let’s say that we eventually reach somewhere we are proud of. Something we think has value. Then pave a path to here. Make it a little bit easier to reach here.</p>

<p>Even if you just start with a trail, as more people go through it, it might become a gravel road. A wooden pathway. A freeway.</p>

<p>This the impact we leave on the world. We make things easier for others, so that they can explore even further horizons. Doesn’t the idea that someone who walked your path might discover things that will fundamentally change our society sound good?</p>

<h2 id="bright-days-ahead">Bright Days Ahead</h2>

<p>The other thing is that… I think there are bright days ahead. And I’m not sure if it is the imminent nuclear disaster, or the death of the ozone layer so that the days become even more hot. But I do believe that the future will be good. Hell, even better than the present, or the past.</p>

<p>Have a bit more hope. I want to see a smile on your face in the future. Let’s [[Rejoice]] with friends, laugh and have fun. There are good people out there too. I hope we find them. Just like RedNoobBuddy and BlueNoobBuddy.</p>

<p>I know we’ll look back, so let’s leave something good to look back on. Let’s not frick it up.</p>

<p>This was a minor point compared to the land of no paths.</p>

<h2 id="the-invasion-of-post-its">The Invasion of Post Its</h2>

<p>This is not a opinion or theory, but more of an observation. Post it notes are taking over. Help.</p>

<hr />

<p>I genuinely hope that things are better there. Be better to your friends, your teachers, and yourselves.</p>

<p>As we used to say:</p>

  <p>Let’s take on the world</p>
