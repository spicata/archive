    <p>Set during the [[Medieval Age (Romanticism)]] and embeds supernatural elements. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“knight-at-arms”</li>
  <li>“faery’s child”</li>
  <li>“her Elfin grot”</li>
</ul>

<p>It also heavily uses nature as the environment (“sedge has withered from the lake”)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as well as a stand-in for human emotion (“fever-dew”, “cheeks a fading rose”). Human emotion is itself a defining [[Quality of Romanticism]], and this is also explored in this poem in the form of the love between the knight and the lady.</p>

<p>I thought that you could liken this poem to how industrialisation seems promising at first, but is actually a bait, and leads to the degradation of the environment, and once you’ve been in an urban landscape, you’ll struggle being in a rural one. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
