    <p>A change in the number of protons in an atom means that the element has changed. A change in the number of neutrons means that it is now a different isotope. Isotopes are the same element, but have slightly different properties. Elements can be in several different “structure”. Some isotopes are stable, others are radioactive (see also [[Radioactive Elements]]). Diamonds are different to carbon nanotubes which in turn is different to coal. These are all allotropes of carbon (see also [[Allotropes]]). A change in the number of electrons leads to ions.</p>
