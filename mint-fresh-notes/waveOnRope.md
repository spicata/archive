- Dasindu tricked me.
- When a pulse reaches the end of a fixed end, then due to the Newton's Third Law of Motion, the fixed end will also exert a opposite but equal the force onto the rope, which will create a trough heading in the opposite direction. This is a phase inversion/reversal. Very cool.
