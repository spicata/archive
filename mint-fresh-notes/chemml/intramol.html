      <p>Intramolecular bonding is like the opposite of intermolecular bonding. Intermolecular bonding happens between molecules, and intramolecular bonding happens within a molecule. This would be metallic, ionic, or covalent bonding.</p>

<h2 id="metallic">Metallic</h2>

<p>Metals have an relatively low electronegativity. They don’t really like to keep their valence electrons (of which they have few of), and they would rather just give them away. Because of this, when lots of metal atoms are together, they simple give away all of their valence electrons and they form a delocalised sea of electrons, almost like a community bank. However, the metal ions (now positive) are attracted to the sea of electrons (negative), and so they stay together. It is this sea that gives metals lots of it’s characteristic properties. Firstly, the bonding of metals are non-directional, because the sea is delocalised, it moves around everywhere. This is why metals are so malleable and ductile, the electrons can move around and the metal ions stay bonded. These electrons are also able to absorb light and re-emit it, giving it its characteristic lustrous look (that means shiny, it’s good to increase your vocab). Finally, it can conduct electricity and heat because of its free electrons, which can move around to carry kinetic energy (heat) or carry its charge (it is negatively charged).</p>

<h2 id="covalent">Covalent</h2>

<p>Non-metals, on the other hand, have a relatively high electronegativity. That means that they’d rather keep their valence electrons, so when they bond, they share electrons instead. No-one of them really wants to lose it, so they need to compromise. It’s directional, because once you’ve made a bond, that bond has to essentially stay that way. It is quite strong. There are two different types of covalent bonding: molecular and network.</p>
