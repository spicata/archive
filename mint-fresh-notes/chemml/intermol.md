Where does the word international come from? Well, we know that a 'nation' is something like a country. We also know that the prefix 'inter-' means between many things. International in its entirety means something like something that happens between many countries.

Similarly, intermolecular bonding is the bonding between many different molecules. They aren't exact as strong intramolecular bonding (the bonding within a molecule), but they still have quite an impact.

## Dipole-Dipole

Electronegativity is this tendency/degree for an atom to attract electrons. Non-metals tend to have a higher electronegativity, whilst metals have a lower electronegativity. This property dictates how the atoms bond. Within a covalent molecule, the difference in electronegativity is not enough to fully steal-lose electrons, however, the difference in electronegativity still has an impact. Importantly, it 'tilts' the balance of the electrons; they will tend to hang around closer to the more electronegative atom.

> Key point: There will be an unequal distribution of electrons.

However, an unequal distribution of electrons means an unequal distribution of charge. One side will end up being slightly more positive than the other. This creates a 'polar bond'. However, if the molecule itself is symmetrical, then the molecule ends up being non-polar. Think of it this way: the 'polarity' is all equally exerted in opposite direction, so that it all cancels out.

> Key point: Symmetrical molecules are non-polar, even if they have polar bonds.

Following on from that logic, an asymmetrical molecule with polar bonds is polar. However, it isn't quite fair to call the negative side a complete 'dipole' (a positively or negatively charged end), and so we call it a 'temporary/partial dipole'. In this sense, ionic bonds can be just seen as extreme polar bond.

However, sometimes, you get molecules consisting of only one type of atom. For example, the oxygen molecule (diatomic). Within this molecule, the two atoms share the same electronegativity, which means that the electrons are shared equally between them. In this case, then that bond is a pure covalent bond, and it is non-polar.

However, how does polarity become intermolecular bonding? Well, because these polar molecules have positively charged ends and negatively charged ends, these ends are attracted to each other due to electrostatic attraction. A higher polarity means a stronger bond.

> Key point: polar molecules are bonded through electrostatic attraction

However, there is an edge case for this, because nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine all have massively large electronegativity. They do...

### Hydrogen Bonding

Hydrogen bonding is a subset of dipole-dipole bonding. Because nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine all have such high electronegativites, and since hydrogen has a relatively low electronegativity. This means that the electrons spend most of it's time next to N, O, or F (NOF) and the bond becomes highly polar. Due to this, the hydrogen has a very negative partial dipole, which leads then to bond with the lone pair of NOF which itself has a hydrogen bond.

> Key point: there is a different type of bonding for when NOF and hydrogen bond.

## Dispersion

Wait... but liquids and solids exist, even if the molecules within it are non-polar. How does that exist?

The last of these forces applies to literally all molecules. By sheer, random chance, every once in a while, the electron distribution within an atom might become asymmetrical. When this happens, a very temporary dipole is made. However, this dipole will cause other atoms in close proximity to also become very weakly polar, and they will attract each other due to electrostatic attraction. 

> Key point: dispersion happens randomly. It affects everything.

Something key factors influence the strength of dispersion forces. Dispersion relies on proximity, if you increase the pressure, the substance starts to condense even at the same temperature. More electrons means that there is more chances for a temporary dipole to appear, increasing the net strength of dispersion forces. More surface area also means more dispersion forces, as dispersion forces only occur at the surface of a molecule. Being able to be more crammed (i.e. more simple shapes) means that it can also be more close, leading to higher dispersion forces.

## Solubility

A little note: solubility is also influenced by the type of intermolecular bonding. Intermolecular bonding is how these substances are held together, and solubility is how these bonds break apart. Water is a great solvent because it is already a polar molecule with a high polarity, and so it already easily breaks apart polar solutes. Again, ionic molecules are like an extreme polar bond, and so it breaks apart easily as well. An easy example of this is sugar[^1] and salt. However, water is not particularly good at breaking apart non-polar bonds.

> Key point: polar solvents break polar solutes. Non-polar solvents break non-polar solutes.
