    <p>You know why using a mechanical keyboard is so fun? Because it is clicky. And noisy. And mainly noisy. By typing you get instant feedback with a satisfying feel and noise. Who doesn’t love the click<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>?</p>

<p>It works because humans are monkeys. Sensory stimulation is good, and we like feedback for actions. Specifically immediate returns. Humans love them.</p>

<p>Our brains priorities immediacy. However, we manipulate this to reinforce our actions. If we are able to attach short-term benefits to a thing that pays of in the long-term, our monkey brain and our brain brain will work together to accomplish it (see also: [[Planning into the Future]]).</p>
