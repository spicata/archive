    <p>Romanticism was the “people’s” literature<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It was [[qoq]] informal (for the time), not filled with jargon, and understandable. Romantic authors enjoyed nature greatly, especially what they called the “sublime”. They also believed in human emotion and intuition over pure reasoning. After all, writing <em>is</em> art. They also had trust in the power of human imagination. And also came back to mythological stories.</p>
