    <p>Irrational numbers are numbers that are not rational. There are loads, like $\pi$, $e$, $\sqrt{ 2 }$, $\tau$, and $\phi$. We have an infinite number of them. Any square roots of non-perfect-square are irrational, and there are others too.</p>

<p>Let’s play number line dart. I’ll throw a dart, and it will land somewhere on the number line. If we have $\infty$ rational numbers, and $\infty$ irrational ones, we have a 50-50 chance right? Wrong. We actually have a 0-100 chance. It is still technically possible to land on a rational number, but the chance literally approaches 0 infinitely.</p>
