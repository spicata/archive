<h1 id="achieved">Achieved</h1>

<p>November has been strangely cool this year, almost as if winter had never ended. Strange, considering that we border summer now. This month will be remembered as exam month.</p>

<p>The biggest thing is that I survived exams. However, I think another important thing is that I seem to have learnt a lot. The coming days seem brighter, and I’ve found where I struggle. I also seemed to have gotten my life together. My Obsidian vault has changed drastically during the last few days of the month, and now that exams are over, I finally get to study what I <em>want</em>, and not what I <em>need</em>.</p>

<p>It has also been a month since switching operating system to Linux Mint, and honestly, I am pretty happy with it. It can be a little unstable here and there but in general, it works perfectly, sometimes better that Windows.</p>

<p>Overall, its been a great month. I had hiccups here and there, but I got by with a smile.</p>

<h1 id="evaluate">Evaluate</h1>

<p>The striking issue is that the Zettelkasten is not bulletproof. As I briefly outlined in [[Problems with Zettelkasten]], the Zettelkasten fails at high-memorisation low-linking subjects, such as biology. Due to this, I was pushed to make [[Biology Flashcards]].</p>

<p>Zettelkasten also doesn’t seem to work when cramming. Of course, in a perfect world, I wouldn’t cram, however, sometimes it seems necessary. I realised this when preparing for Biology on the 14th.</p>

<p>Another problem is that my habit of not using social media or YouTube broke down during the end of the month.</p>

<h1 id="design">Design</h1>

<p>Regarding social media, I have decided to allocate a corner of my room to fun. That means doing Discord, playing games, whatever. At the table I work on, I have decided to only get production done.</p>

<p>Regarding the Zettelkasten, I can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Incorporate flashcards into learning habit</li>
  <li>Find alternative ways of linking notes</li>
  <li>Create redundancy</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="flashcards">Flashcards</h2>

<p>Flashcards are relatively easy to implement into the current system. Flashcards also definitely work when used properly, and they are good for many things, such as biology and languages. However, flashcards are difficult to use properly. They need constant checking and reviewing, a single missed day can destroy your schedule, making it harder to catch up. The also take up a considerable amount of time to make and review.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-links">Alternative Links</h2>

<p>A different method could be taken to create links between notes. Currently, I use links to generate understanding. For example, the links coming of [[4 - Alpha Decay]] are links that explain parts of the entire puzzle.</p>

<p>However, a strategy can be employed where instead of “understanding” links, I use “thematic” links. The current tag system is a good example of this. It highlights the common principles found between notes. Also, I could create “ideal” links, where links are made from idea to idea, such as what happens in the <em>Study of Study</em>.</p>

<p>The main problem is that I do not have a clear understanding of this system would work. I also have not used this in a grounded sense, meaning that I am unaware of how effective this is.</p>

<h2 id="redundancy">Redundancy</h2>

<p>I could work to create redundancy between notes. This does not mean repetition, but includes overstudying and a great deal of depth. For example, when a question asks for A, you give A, B, C, and D. This is redundancy.</p>

<p>The two issues with this would be that the time taken would increase, as I would need to create redundant notes, and that this would add unnecessary bloat to the vault.</p>

<h1 id="moving-forwards">Moving Forwards</h1>

<p>Dear December 2022 me,</p>

<p>How are you? How is the holidays? Has anything big occurred? Have you had any regrets?</p>

<p>I’ll hope you’ve been doing well. By then, I wish that you would have finished <em>Study of Study</em>. Is it beneficial much? Has anything changed? I also would like believe that you would’ve added redundancy and a better way to link notes together, although I’d admit that it seems as though it will take some time.</p>

<p>I just want to make sure that everything is going alright. How is being at the edge of 2023? Remember, its okay to just sit back for a bit, as long as you get back up, not that I believe that you won’t.</p>

<p>Also, I hope that you are better at writing these letters than me. It’s a little weird doing it. I’ll leave you to it.</p>

<p>Good luck,<br />
November 2022 me :<em>)</em></p>
