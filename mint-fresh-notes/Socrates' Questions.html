    <p>Socrates knew he knew nothing, so to find out, he questioned everything logically. He would find contradictions, then remove said contradictions, then question again. By removing contradictions, he must have been getting closer to the truth. But without these questions, people simply followed the majority, whether it was the truth or not.</p>
