      <p>i have no damn clue how to go about this.</p>

<p>this is where the problem lays: i need to find a general rule that allows me to find the number of different loops of a certain length (let’s say $p$). i was thinking of using something like $l$ for loop length and $n$ for the n-permutator.</p>

<p>but you know, i am kind of an idiot when it comes to this stuff, and i’ve got no clue how to do this. i know for a fact that $l=1\implies p=1$ but apart from that, i can’t seem to find a rule. also i have the problem of $l=6$ which is very bad, because lets say we have a loop $l=3$ and one $l=2$, then the total loop length is 6, not 3 nor 2. now i’ve got no clue how on earth to tackle this problem, and that is not good. (unexpected). so anyways. i’m running on like 5 hours of sleep.</p>
