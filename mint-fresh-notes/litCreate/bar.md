He stood in front of the bar. Warm, comforting lights drew him in; moths to a dazzling lamp, incapacitating. It was a flight from worries and responsibilities. The ringing, drinking, shouting, stumbling back.

"You okay?" Someone had taken a seat next to him. Kind yet infinitely deep eyes looked straight at him without a single break in eye contact.

"I'm fine."

"Sorry," apologies the stranger, suddenly, "was a little too abrupt. Been a long week." Robert sighed in agreement. "You come to wind down too, eh? Escape reality for a bit?" A blanket of silence fell over them, the stranger shifting uncomfortably in his seat. "Well, I dunno about you, but it's been hard, don't feel like myself. Always lying to the world." Robert back at him; his attention was caught on a far off line. He watched as the stranger sank further into his story.
