    <p>it was a dark night, the full moon in the sky illuminating all around, yet the building remained ever dark, like an infinite void. perhapds it was the ever present, black smoke-like mist that linger around the once-great concert hall, laying there as the destroyer of light. but rumour has it that it were simply a special property of this house, as from within, neither light, nor sound would be able to enter. from inside, there was no iotside. and yet the house was able to so toatally capture his attention that we would forever be enticied towards it. the simple lack of information <del>offr</del> afforded was enough to engagine hime. and so everyday,  in the early hours of teh monrning, he would walk a little closer to the house that once housed great nmucisiamns, alone in sea of silence.</p>

<p>one peculiar day , howver, he canme to notice a rather heavy footsteps, one of tremednous weight in, lingering/hagning in the cold winterish air. alone in the seas of quietude,. and it was hthis combinaition that sent his curisoity into overdrive. questions raced in his head : “who else could that ebe in this dead of the night?”. quick ratioanalisations filled his head, possibily it was just a patrolling officer , who chanced to apepar here in this specific time and day. but the footsetteps still layed uneasy with huim, ad he would acarry this unease until the bed,.</p>

<p>the floorbaoards creakedunder his weight as he creeped through the house, and i echoed throught the corrider. all of it was quiet, until the deep pounding of the once-heard footsepts returned, but  only closer and lourder this time.</p>
