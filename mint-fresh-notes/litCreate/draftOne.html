<p>All the streetlights were out, they were never quite well-funded enough; the only light would be the dim quarter moon that barely lit up the surroundings, the dark midnight smog only worsening the situation. Despite that, Robert was able to navigate this street, he had memorised itâ€™s every crevice during the dozen years he had walked down it, always in the embrace of the dark night sky, when all else rest. Silence surrounded him, and only his featherlight footsteps ever reverberated down these streets. And yet, the abandoned house always remained there, once a great auditorium housing great musicians.</p>

Robert looked back at all the times he had faced until then. He saw a little siholleute, far yet clear. A rather rotund figure, along with 4 other, more lean than the first, stood around; quickly running back into abonded house.</p>
