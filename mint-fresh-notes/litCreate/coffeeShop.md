Everyday, he goes to the little coffee shop jammed into a wall of buildings facing the busiest road of the city. As always, he orders the usual, pays, sits down, looks outside. People and cars mingling, filling the road. He drinks his coffee, checks his phone, glances at the news, inaudible, gets up, and leaves, little chiming at the door, catching the late bus to home.
