    <p>A letter:</p>

<p>I simply cannot take it anymore. Everyday, I wake up and I put on a mask, and I become someone I am not, and for what? I slave away, trying to maintain this facade, so that I can maintain my reputation? For what it’s worth, I think I’m wasting my life. My reputation against my sanity, and yet I am unable to break out of this forever repeating loop, because I’m afraid. Fear is what keeps me in this perpetual hell, and had I been braver, I may have been able to lead a better life.</p>

<p>But it is that stinging fear that maybe people will be taken aback, shocked by the transformation. And much like an unexercised muscle, it has wasted away, and I feel that I am no longer able to act with sincerity, my mind trapped as a prisoner within the bounds of what I have built for myself. And so I avoided the problem, drank away at the bar every night, an attempt to erase any semblance of though within my head. To fill up every gap in time where I may fall back into the self-loathing agony. And yet the pain never really went away. It stayed, sapping away at my soul, taking advantage of the newly weakened will that once kept it at bay.</p>

<p>And one day, I met you. And I saw you treading the path that I so despised; saw you waiting, pleading, for it to stop. To be free from your troubles.</p>

<p>And so I tried to help, and in doing so, I think I helped myself.</p>

<p>By the time you are reading, I will have escaped this place. I will have travelled far. I know that I will meet you again.</p>

<p>I’m sorry I could not stay,<br />
Your friend,<br />
- unnamed yet.</p>
