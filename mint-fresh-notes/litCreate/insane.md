A letter:

I simply cannot take it anymore. Everyday, I wake up and I put on a mask, and I become someone I am not, and for what? I slave away, trying to maintain this facade, so that I can maintain my reputation? For what it's worth, I think I'm wasting my life. My reputation against my sanity, and yet I am unable to break out of this forever repeating loop, because I'm afraid. Fear is what keeps me in this perpetual hell, and had I been braver, I may have been able to lead a better life.

But it is that stinging fear that maybe people will be taken aback, shocked by the transformation. And much like an unexercised muscle, it has wasted away, and I feel that I am no longer able to act with sincerity, my mind trapped as a prisoner within the bounds of what I have built for myself. And so I avoided the problem, drank away at the bar every night, an attempt to erase any semblance of though within my head. To fill up every gap in time where I may fall back into the self-loathing agony. And yet the pain never really went away. It stayed, sapping away at my soul, taking advantage of the newly weakened will that once kept it at bay.

And one day, I met you. And I saw you treading the path that I so despised; saw you waiting, pleading, for it to stop. To be free from your troubles.

And so I tried to help, and in doing so, I think I helped myself.

By the time you are reading, I will have escaped this place. I will have travelled far. I know that I will meet you again. 

I'm sorry I could not stay,  
Your friend,  
\- unnamed yet.
