  <li>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory (vsepr) is a theory that describe how molecules form their shapes.</li>
  <li>Electrons, being negatively charged, all repel each other when they are near each other. Obviously, the core shells are all filled to stability, and so it is the valence electrons that will shapes (haha) in what shape the atoms bind to each other.</li>
  <li>Please remember that atoms are actually three-dimensional objects, and not just drawing on a 2D plane. This means that some atoms will be connected to the ‘back’ of other atoms and such.</li>
  <li>There are two measurements we can take in looking at the shape of a molecule. The bond length, which is the distance from one connected atom to another atom. The bond angle is the smallest angle between two different bond.</li>
