    <p>Atomic radius is the radius of the atom. Unexpected. Obviously, the more electron shells an atom has, the bigger itâ€™ll be, so as you move down the periodic table, the atomic radius as bigger. Interestingly, the more right we go, the stronger the positive charge in the nucleus becomes, and so the electrons are actually drawn further towards the nucleus, resulting in a smaller atomic radius. Helium has a smaller radius than lithium.</p>
