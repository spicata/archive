    <p>[[Gravimetric Analysis]] gives us the percentage that each component makes up a mixture. We can use this for empirical formula (see [[Empirical n Molecular]])! Let’s say I have a certain liquid, let’s say water and it has a mass of 100g. Then I run a gravimetric analysis of the water, and it is 89% oxygen and 11% hydrogen. So then the oxygen has a total mass of around 89g, and hydrogen has a mass of around 11g. How many moles in 89g of oxygen? [[Calc Moles]] is the answer.</p>

\[\begin{align}
n(O)&amp;=\frac{m(O)}{M(O)} \\
n(O)&amp;=\frac{89g}{16g} \\
n(O)&amp;=5.5625\text{ mol} \\
\\
n(H)&amp;=\frac{m(H)}{M(H)} \\
n(H)&amp;=\frac{11g}{1g} \\
n(H)&amp;=11\text{ mol}
\end{align}\]

<p>So then, we have around 5.5 moles of oxygen and around 11 moles of hydrogen. That gives us a ratio of 5.5(O):11(H), or 1(O):2(H). So then, water has an empirical formula of $H_{2}O$. Makes sense? Hopefully.</p>
