    <p>Neoclassicism is primarily focused with the ancient greeks and romans, what we call antiquity, as well as their works which came to be known as the classics. Romanticism has a similar “mentor” figure, and that is the middle/medieval ages.</p>

<p>Walter Scott and Coleridge originally used the medieval ages as a sign of chivalry. A good time that had passed. However, later romantics adopted the medieval age to critique the effects of the Industrial revolution and the appalling working conditions.</p>
