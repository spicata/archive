    <p>Sometimes, you have suspicions that someone or something is plotting against you. That’s paranoia. And fear is an inbuilt structure of humanity. It was useful to be able to see a tiger in the bush and react appropriately, even if it wasn’t actually a tiger, because it was better to be safe than to be sorry.</p>

<p>But nowadays, this fear of fear has changed the way we act, and for worse. Your opponents don’t usually act like the way you think. But because of our paranoia, we believe they will. 99 times out of 100, they don’t. But we irrationally believe that it will happen (see also [[Loss Aversion]]). Don’t act in fear.</p>
