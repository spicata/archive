<ul>
  <li>[[Proof]]s are fun. It means different thing in different contexts, but cause math is pure, it just comes down to thinking. You don’t need evidence or whatever.</li>
  <li>Math is the superior subject.</li>
  <li>Difference between [[Proof vs Evidence]]</li>
  <li>Had a look at Goldbach’s conjecture</li>
  <li>Is this really necessary? Yes.</li>
  <li>Other than theorems, we have [[Axiom]]s.</li>
  <li>We play with theorem lego.</li>
  <li>Some theorems are looong.</li>
  <li>Here is how to succeed:
    <ul>
      <li>Focus in class, regularly review, try to keep up with the class, do past exams, and ask for help.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="03th-of-february-2023">03th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An example of a proof. It was a proof that he co-authored. It was too complicated for us to really understand. I just listened because he seemed happy explaining it.</li>
  <li>A lemma is a little theorem.</li>
  <li>We look a bit into different [[Proof Types]]</li>
  <li>Started looking at [[Set]]s, including the special (black-board) ones. Apparently $\mathbb{Z}$ stands for something in German.</li>
  <li>[[Irrational Number]]s are plenty. We also played some number line dart, and we came back to the infinite hotel again.</li>
  <li>Also looked at [[Set Notation]].</li>
  <li>Conditional statements are “if … then …” statements. We also sometimes use the $\implies$ symbol. We’re not proving if the “if” is true, we’re just looking at the relationship.
    <ul>
      <li>We assume that “if” is true.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We also use QED.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="06th-of-february-2023">06th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Here are some proof principles:
    <ul>
      <li>Proofs should be precise and unambiguous.</li>
      <li>You should be able to replace the symbols are read it out. Use linking words like you do in English</li>
      <li>Statements are either true, or they instruct the reader to do something/notice something/anything else I guess.</li>
      <li>Written in first person plural. We are on a journey to the truth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In short: like an IKEA manual.</li>
  <li>There are some common mistakes. Here’s how to fix it:
    <ul>
      <li>Variables are constant. That is to say, don’t use one variable to define two different things &gt;:-(. This is because you want to…</li>
      <li>Make sure it is general. It should apply to all case possible within the limits of the question.</li>
      <li>If you can’t find a direction, just suppose that this happens, and try all the different possibilities. This is exhaustion.</li>
      <li>DON’T ASSUME THAT THE STATEMENT IS TRUE. This was so bad that Dr Pearce drew this (imitation):<br />
![[Angry Pearce.png]]</li>
      <li>Write rough wok when stuck.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pearce got jumpscared by smartboard options.</li>
  <li>We did Exercise 6A. If you didn’t finish it, it’s homework.
    <ul>
      <li>Got stuck on 18 :-/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes, we get an if-then-question, but don’t know what to do. This usually happens if the then-part is longer than the if-part. If this is the case, we can use <strong>proof by contrapositive</strong>.</li>
  <li>There are many ways to find the “opposite” of a statement
    <ul>
      <li>Negation: if A then B –&gt; if A then not B
        <ul>
          <li>This looks for “the rest”, not the opposite. For example, not-greater is smaller-or-equal-to.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inverse: if A then B –&gt; if B then A</li>
      <li>Converse: if A then B –&gt; if not A then not B</li>
      <li>Contrapositive: if A then B –&gt; if not B then not A
        <ul>
          <li>This is the only one that is true.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When doing not’s, we need to keep in mind <em>De Morgan’s law</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>not(A and B) = not A or not B</li>
      <li>not(A or B) = not A and not B</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Homework: Ex6B (all)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9th-of-february-2023">9th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Please get the new Cambridge book please. It has different stuff.</li>
  <li>If the converse (see above) is also true, then A and B are equivalent.
    <ul>
      <li>A &lt;=&gt; B (or A if and only if B, which is shortened to A iff B)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We went into the linguistics of “if and only if”</li>
  <li>A &lt;=&gt; B is the proved by A =&gt; B &amp; B =&gt; A.</li>
  <li>Another way is P &lt;=&gt; R &lt;=&gt; Q. It is also possible to take different routes, such as P =&gt; R =&gt; Q, Q =&gt; S =&gt; P</li>
  <li>Combi won’t be in the test.</li>
  <li>Quote of the day: “feature of english language”</li>
  <li>(Homework) Did 6C (6B if not finished). We are going quick, but please try to keep up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10th-of-february-2023">10th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Looked at [[Quantifiers]], and [[Proving with Quantifiers]].</li>
  <li>Confused Pearce?</li>
  <li>Did 6D (6C if not finished), do for homework.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="13th-of-february-2023">13th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We are gonna be finishing proofs soon.</li>
  <li>We looked at [[Proof by Contradiction]]. Examples are:
    <ul>
      <li>Proof of infinite primes</li>
      <li>Proof of square root of 2 irrationality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ex13a (Homework)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="14th-of-february-2023">14th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Homework: Anything you haven’t finished from Chapter 6 and 13</li>
  <li>Recurring decimals are rational.</li>
  <li>Interval notation.</li>
</ul>
