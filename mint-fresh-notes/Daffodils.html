    <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host, of golden daffodils;<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>

<p>Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
They stretched in never-ending line<br />
Along the margin of a bay:<br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>

<p>The waves beside them danced; but they<br />
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
A poet could not but be gay,<br />
In such a jocund company:<br />
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br />
What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>

<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
And dances with the daffodils.</p>

<p><em>Daffodils</em> by William Wordsworth shows the carefree and childish-innocence characteristic of many romantic pieces that came about as a reaction to the purely logical world that the [[Enlightenment (Romanticism)]] brought about. In “I wandered lonely as a cloud”, Wordsworth gives the impression that much like a cloud in a clear sky, he is alone in his journey. However, in doing so, he attaches the cloud’s qualities to himself, qualities such as free and weightless, showing the carefree nature of the Romantics. This idea of being freed by nature and emotion from the shackles of the modern industrial world is one commonly echoed in many Romantic works.</p>

<p>There is also the all-encompassing theme of nature within this work, wherein the narrator finds an inner peace with solitude in nature. The heavy amounts of vivid, sensory imagery allows us to grasp the beauty of nature through Wordsworth’s eyes. The golden daffodils, the milky ways, the waves are all facets of nature to which Romantics show their true appreciation. Their personification through dancing shows nature as living and almost sentient, Wordsworth to join the dance further emphasising that humans should exist as a part of this whole. (We already know the impact that nature had on Romanticism, so we should probably refer to the notes: [[Quality of Romanticism]], [[Romanticism 2]])</p>
