    <p>The [[Birth of Romanticism]] happened during when Europe was industrialising and urbanising. Romantic poets was deeply regretful of this evolution of humanity, and preferred the rural, nature-filled existence. After all, things become more valuable the less we have of it. This was the case with nature.</p>

<p>[[Gothic]] literature was also developing during this era, and both movements benefited from each other. They share several similar themes, such as the emphasis of the supernatural and the sublime, as well as the study of ruins.</p>
