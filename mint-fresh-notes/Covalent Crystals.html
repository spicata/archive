    <p>Covalent crystals are made up of covalently bonded atoms. In a covalent network, there are covalent bonds in three directions, with strong covalent attraction between atoms. There is no mobile charge, meaning that it isn’t conductive, except in the case of graphite, but that’s mostly 2D anyways.</p>

<p>There is also covalent molecule crystals. In these crystal, covalently bonded molecules exist amongst each other. Much like within the nucleus, each of the atoms are strongly bonded within the molecule, but each molecule is loosely bonded with the ones around it, creating a low melting point and soft.</p>
