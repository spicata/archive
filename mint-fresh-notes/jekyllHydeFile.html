    <ul>
  <li>conflict between jekyll and hyde can be understood through a victorian context
    <ul>
      <li>during the victorian era, society was big on reputation, and this led to a disparity between the a person’s public and private life</li>
      <li>their public life was what others could see, whilst the private life would be kept secret</li>
      <li>this is kind of seen in utterson, who had things that he liked to do, but outwardly he was kind of a little dead.</li>
      <li>however, this is (obviously) more explored in the character of jekyll</li>
      <li>also, before we go into jekyll, another literary movement that happened during this time was the gothic movement</li>
      <li>the gothic movement was more focused on terror and horror, and it was kind of just a revival of gothic arts that existed in medieval times.</li>
      <li>gothicism was also kind of reflective in the way that the protagonist and the antagonists kind of reflected aspects of humanity.</li>
      <li>protagonists were flawed, and the antagonists revealed our deepest fears. they were mirrors to us.</li>
      <li>jekyll and hyde was kind of the mirrors of the disparity of victorian society. it seemed innovative, and it’s people celibate. however, hyde sort of acted as the mirror to the soft underbelly of victorian society.</li>
      <li>hyde is the surpressed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>freudian psychoanalysis
    <ul>
      <li>hyde can be seen as the unconscious of jekyll</li>
      <li>all the surpressed feelings and shtuff got saved into what we come to know as hyde</li>
      <li>this being is only released through jekyll’s experiment, and until then was controlled by jekyll.</li>
      <li>jekyll here is the ego of sorts, but also contains superego.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>don’t worry, i made this, not chatgpt. chatgpt doesn’t write this badly :-}</li>
  <li>jekyll and hyde may have been influenced heavily by charles darwin’s evolution theory.
    <ul>
      <li>darwin’s theory on evolution (seemingly) clashed with the idea that god made everything in its current form</li>
      <li>darwin’s theory also posited that humans and animals aren’t too dissimilar
        <ul>
          <li>we both have the same ancestors</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>this lead to a fear that, if we could evolve, one could also devolve</li>
      <li>this could be seen in hyde, who is often depicted as almost simian.</li>
      <li>different characters describe him as: monkeyish, troglodytic, primal, so on so forth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>hyde is often alluded to re
    <ul>
      <li>utterson called him satan</li>
    </ul>
