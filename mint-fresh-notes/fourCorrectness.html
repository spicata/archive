    <p>There are 4 measures of “correctness”: precision, accuracy, reliability, and validity. I’ll quote this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!QUOTE] Measures of correctness
Precision: “the fineness of the scale on the instrument that is used to measure”, <strong>OR</strong> “how close the trials for a particular part of our experiment are to each other”.</p>

  <p>Accuracy: “How close the experimentally derived measurement is to its true value.” This is taken as an average, usually.</p>

  <p>Reliability: “If we repeat the experiment, the results are not significantly different from each other.”</p>

  <p>Validity: “No other variable is impacting on the independent or dependent variable.”</p>
