    <p>Gothic literature (i dunno man i would call it a movement) likes: fear, terror, horror (are they not the same?), and wonder. It builds suspense, and deals with the death-y and supernatural (much like the Romantics). Despite being known for fear, it’s wonder arises with the sublime. That means a great beauty.</p>

<p>It’s often discontinuous in its storytelling, and features stories within stories (mmm recursion). It also likes an unreliable narrator (great way to build suspense and mislead the readers i guess).</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>It’s pretty similar to Romanticism in a way. Gothic is seen as a pre-romanticisim, and they both like to deal with the supernatural and the sublime, albeit in different ways. There were also a group of romanticists called the graveyard poets “,:-</td>
      <td>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Also, many writers during Gothic-ism, many [[Gothic Authors]] were female, which for the time was pretty radical. It also added to the build-up of modern science-fiction, with works like Frankenstein that explored scientific stuff.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria killed Romanticism and Gothic literature.</p>
