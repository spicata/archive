    <p>We can draw covalent bonds using the Lewis dot diagram as well as the line-bond structure. You’ve seen it before, in [[Covalent Bonding]], where I drew the funny dots and lines to show how the atoms were linked.</p>

<p>What the Lewis dot diagram does is is shows all the valence electrons, and shows how the atoms share pairs of electrons, as is the case in the $H_{2}O$ above. The hydrogen atoms share one electron with the oxygen, and vice versa, allowing all three atoms to have a fully filled shell.</p>

<p>We can depict the same with line-bond structure.</p>

<p>Note however that the Lewis dot diagram and line-bond structure don’t actually show what the molecule looks like in 3D. For example, water actually has an angle of 104.5 degrees.</p>
