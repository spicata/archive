      <blockquote>
  <p>Gothic fictions in the late Victorian era presented the conditions for a shift in the conception of how character works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a context/hook statement. Note how it is just a general statement about texts, here in a specific context (gothic).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During this period, the creation of prominent literary personae such as Jekyll and Hyde, Sherlock Holmes, and Dorian Gray came to rely less the personality of their fictional identities and more on their ability to stand in for and elicit reactions to complex social, political, and economic debates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an elaboration of the context statement. It goes into a bit more depth and explains what it means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By this I do not mean that the characters are “flat” in the sense E. M. Forster proposes when he states in Aspects of Novel (1927) that such characters are, in their purest form, “constructed round a single idea quality” (103-04). What I mean is rather that the specific manner in which these character are composed has been directed in such a way so as to deny the evolution of emotion intellectual, and moral traits in favor of a narrative approach that employs fictional identity as a location for the representation of important social questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defining key terms and clarifying meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the final decades of the nineteenth century, character, I suggest, provides a particularly important site for writers construct difficult arguments.</p>
