  <p>[!TIP] (Somewhat) Helpful thing
Here is the ö from Schrödinger’s name, just in case you want to type it. It’s too annoying to type though, because I don’t have an international keyboard, so I’ll just say Schrodinger.</p>

<p>Schrodinger say Bohr’s shell model (see [[Shell Model]]) and thought he could improve it<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So he did. Here it is.</p>

<p>To accomodate for the fact that particles are funny and they want to be both waves and particles at the same time, instead of having strict shells, Schrodinger based it off of density. The electrons were more likely to be in this area than this other area. This creates zones, which roughly align with Bohr’s shells where electrons are likely to be in.</p>
