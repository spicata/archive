    <p>Who does hydrogen hang out with?</p>

<p>He’s put above the alkali metals, because he’s highly reactive like them. But halogens are also reactive, and like the halogens, hydrogen form diatomic molecules. But also, under extreme circumstances, hydrogen acts like a metal because his electrons disassociate.</p>

<p>So… is hydrogen a metal? Is it a halogen? Is it alkali? Who knows.</p>
