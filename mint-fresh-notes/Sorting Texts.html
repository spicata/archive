    <p>Texts is sometimes split by genre. <strong>First</strong>, it is classified by what type of text it is. Essentially, what form does it take? Is it a video? Is it a novel? Is it a picture? <strong>Then</strong>, it is classified by genre, which is usually the themes present in the text. Is it sci-fi? Is it horror? I don’t know, you tell me. You’re the one reading the text, I’m just writing this paragraph. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>Texts can also be split by historical periods. This is the time that it was produced. Produced during Queen Victoria’s rule in Britain? It’s Victorian. Produced after the World Wars? It’s post-war. Makes enough sense.</p>

<p>There are also literary movements. This is based on the ideas and issues explored within the texts, as well as the general style of writing. For example, romanticism, modernism, naturalism ([[Neoclassicism and Romanticism]]). These generally follow a certain date, however, the ends are much more fuzzy. I could also just write something that seems romantic, and it could become part of romanticism.</p>
