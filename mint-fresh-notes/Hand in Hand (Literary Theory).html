    <p>Sometimes, some [[Literary Theory]]s are very good for analysing certain texts. For example (and this is a guess), a feminist theory would probably be good to analyse <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (i think, i havenâ€™t read it). Or you could use a psychoanalytical theory to study <em>The Mysterious Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em>. These go hand in hand, which is very useful for us.</p>
