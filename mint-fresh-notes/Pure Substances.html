Elements are just the elements on the periodic table<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Compounds are made up elements, and they have a fixed atomic ratio. For example, table salt’s chemical compound<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is NaCl, meaning that it always has one sodium atom for each one chlorine atom.</p>

<p>Compounds can be organic or not that<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Organic compounds are compounds containing carbon that is produced by organisms. Inorganic compounds are not produced by organisms. It often has a metal and a non-metal.
