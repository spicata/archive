- Waves are something that transfers energy.
- They can be classified two ways:
    - Mechanical and EMR
    - Transverse and Longitudinal
- Mechanical and EMR depend on the medium through which they propagate.
    - Mechanical waves are waves that spread through particles ???
    - EMR waves (electromagnetic radiation) spread ???
- Transverse and longitudinal waves
    - Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles move in the direction of the wave.
    - Transverse waves are waves where the particles move perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
- Essential wave properties:
    - Reflection: when a wave encounters a media boundary, some of the wave is reflected back (in accordance to the law of reflection).
        - The law of reflection: the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
        - This is what creates echos
    - Refraction: Waves, when they encounter a media boundary, bend away or towards the normal, if not reflected.
    - Diffraction: Waves, when they encounter an obstacle that is equal to or smaller than the wavelength of the wave, 'bend' around said object.
