There are three laws of motion:

1. [An object of mass will remain at rest, or maintain a constant velocity unless an unbalanced force acts upon it.](lawOne)
1. [Force is equal to the acceleration times the mass of an object.](lawTwo)
1. [When two objects exert a force on each other, these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.](lawThree)
