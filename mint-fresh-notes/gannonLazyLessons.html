<ul>
  <li>We started combinatorics: combinations and permutations. They are essentially the same thing, but we divide combinations by “r!”, which are the different ways of organising it.</li>
  <li>Mentioned complementary events, but didn’t go into depth.</li>
  <li>He also talked about “2 to the power of n”, which is the total amount of combination possible (possible).
    <ul>
      <li>For example, there are 7 people you want to invite to your birthday. The first person could either come or not. Ditto for second. Repeat that. In total, you have 2 to the power of 7 possibilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="06th-of-february-2023">06th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We did Ex. 10A-D of Cambridge.</li>
  <li>10D Q6: A sandwich with nothing in it is (sadly) not a sandwich. But apparently a sandwich with only onions is a sandwich. So hm…</li>
  <li>Finished 10A-D, so did Mathspace :-/</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="07th-of-february-2023">07th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Something about how in ye olde times, you got fired when you got pregnant. God bless modern regulations, eh?</li>
  <li>Anyways, it terms of work, we did Pascal’s triangle, and how it relates to combi. Essentially, you can rewrite the triangle tin terms of combinations. Search up some permutation of the words “combination” and “Pascal’s triangle”.
    <ul>
      <li>Also, learn that nCr = (n-1)C(n-r) + (n-1)Cr</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This also leads into binomial expansion.
    <ul>
      <li>The top row is the 0th row. From then on is 1st, then 2nd, then 3rd, so on.</li>
      <li>The numbers in the nth row relate to the coefficients of an expansion of (a+b)^n. E.g. (a+b)^2 = 1a^2 + 2ab + 1b^2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try expanding (2x-4y)^4</li>
  <li>Classwork/homework is q1a, c, e, and g. Then do p.364 and 365.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8th-of-february-2023">8th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We did probability. Do exercises 9A, 9B, and 9C (every second question) for homework</li>
  <li>Investigation coming out Friday</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10th-of-february-2023">10th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Admin stuff</li>
  <li>Test?! It was almost trivial, but that could mean I missed something :-/.
    <ul>
      <li>Never mind it’s all g.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finish stuff from before</li>
  <li>Investigation came out. Supposedly hard, but I found it pretty easy. I am not saying this brag. I’m saying this so that you know that, if you need help, I might be able to help you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="13th-of-february-2023">13th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>[[Probability Venn Diagrams]]</li>
  <li>Lewis Carroll made the universal set. Also wrote Wonderland.</li>
  <li>Ex 9D</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="14th-of-february-2023">14th of February, 2023</h2>

<ul>
  <li>More probability</li>
  <li>No help for investigation</li>
  <li>Homework: Ex9E</li>
</ul>
