    <p>Rate of reaction (or reaction rate) is self-explanatory. Temperature, concentration, gas pressure, and surface area/particle size all influence the reaction rate. Why? Well first go learn [[Collision Theory]].</p>

<hr />

<p>In chem, hotter means faster, and so temperature increases reaction rate. Concentration and gas pressure means more things in less space, and that increases collisions.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. Letâ€™s say we put 10 kids in a classroom. They get to move around a bunch, but they probably will avoid each other. Now letâ€™s cram 100 kids in a classroom. They will bump into each other a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Surface area/particle size also increase collisions. Thisâ€™ll need a diagram</p>

<p>![[Surface Area.png]]</p>

<p>If we cut it in half (imagine they have the same area), then there is red amount more perimeter. Collisions only happen on the perimeter. So more perimeter is better.</p>

<p>By the way, this is called chemical kinetics (I think ðŸ«¤)</p>
