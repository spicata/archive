    <p>Rutherford in 1910 ran the gold-foil experiment. He shot alpha particles from a source towards a thin sheet of gold foil. Under [[JJ Thomson]]â€™s model of the atom, all of the atoms would have based straight through, but some particles were deflected at different angles and caught by a zinc sulfide screen. By doing that, he found that the majority of the positive charge and mass was concentrated in the centre. This was the discovery the nucleus.</p>
