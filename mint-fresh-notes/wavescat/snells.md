- Snell's law can determine the angle of refraction.
- Using the angle of incidence and a materials' refractive indexes, the angle of refraction can be determined, and vice versa.
    - Instead of the refractive index, you could use the velocity of the wave in a substance.

$$\frac{\sin \theta_{1}}{\sin \theta_{2}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}=\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}$$

- Can be understood through [huygen's principle](huygen). Since the wavelets propagate slower through a slower medium (by definition), and so the distance between wavefronts is also smaller, but if that happens mid-way through a medium change, the angle changes.
- If the sin(angle of refraction) > 1, then obviously it is not possible. This means that all of the light was reflected. So yeah, it doesn't actually break it.
