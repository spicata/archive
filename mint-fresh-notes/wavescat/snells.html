    <ul>
  <li>Snell’s law can determine the angle of refraction.</li>
  <li>Using the angle of incidence and a materials’ refractive indexes, the angle of refraction can be determined, and vice versa.
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of the refractive index, you could use the velocity of the wave in a substance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

\[\frac{\sin \theta_{1}}{\sin \theta_{2}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}=\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}\]

<ul>
  <li>Can be understood through <a href="huygen">huygen’s principle</a>. Since the wavelets propagate slower through a slower medium (by definition), and so the distance between wavefronts is also smaller, but if that happens mid-way through a medium change, the angle changes.</li>
  <li>If the sin(angle of refraction) &gt; 1, then obviously it is not possible. This means that all of the light was reflected. So yeah, it doesn’t actually break it.</li>
