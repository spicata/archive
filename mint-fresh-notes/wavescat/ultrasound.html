    <ul>
  <li>Most of the time, not all of the energy will be reflected. Instead, some if it will be reflected back. This is what happens in ultrasound imaging. By the law of reflection, we know that $\theta_{i}=\theta_{r}$. So, we can use this. This is an echo. This can be interpreted by a computer, and create an image. The most common usage of this is getting an image of a fetus (to check normal development).</li>
  <li>The intensity and shape of the wave determines how it is displayed.
    <ul>
      <li>Blood and other fluids reflect less energy, and so it will appear darker on the ultrasound image. Bones and other more solid tissue reflects more, and so it will appear lighter. (so it is based on density)</li>
      <li>Remember that reflection and refraction occurs at a boundary between two media.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Related I think: If you apply a form on energy to crystals, then it gets transferred to some electric energy. This is the piezoelectric effect.</li>
  <li>Uses sound waves with a very high frequency, such as in the 20KHz to MHz range. It’s called ultrasound cause it’s like ultraviolet. Around the 2 to 18 MHz.</li>
  <li>Probes can be put into the body, or just on the skin.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Transmit high-frequency sound wave</li>
  <li>Soundwaves travels through body and hit a media boundry.</li>
  <li>Some of the sound gets reflected back to the probe</li>
  <li>These waves are picked up</li>
  <li>Calculates distance</li>
  <li>Represents image</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>There are piezoelectric crystals inside the ultrasound probe, which can turn electrical energy into sound waves, thus creating the ultrasound, or vice versa, turning the reflected sound into images.</li>
</ul>
