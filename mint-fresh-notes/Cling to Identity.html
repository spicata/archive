    <p>We cling to our identity. Once it is formed, it’s almost like it is set in stone. Why? Well here’s my guess. Changing your identity is difficult, and in this universe only [[Easy Things Happen]]. Secondly, people hold you and judge you based on your old identity. So even if you fundamentally change who you are, people will always associate you with the past.</p>

<p>This happens to anyone. If you’ve tried to convince people, you’ll know that the harder you push, the harder they’ll resist.</p>
