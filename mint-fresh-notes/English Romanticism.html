    <p>English Romanticism was pretty big. It started with the Lake Poets: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. They are called this because they lived near a lake (i presume). They were pretty big. Then we had the Scott Group, withâ€¦ Scott. It also had (Thomas) Campbell and (Thomas) Moore. Finally, we had the Younger Group, with all of the late-romantic poets, such as Byron, Shelly, and Keats. They would suffer a bit more than the other ones.</p>
