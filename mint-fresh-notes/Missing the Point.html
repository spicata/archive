    <p>Missing the point is an idiom, and [[Simplicity is Good]], but I think this idiom is a pretty clear one. It means that you have not understood what the most important part of something is. And we do this all the time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Point of a court: protect people from misunderstanding and other oversights.</p>

    <p>Not: serve as a platform for the guilty to get away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Point of a school: educate children and create an environment that allows people to learn.</p>

    <p>Not: get good grades in a standardised test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Point of money: an easy standardised medium to exchange goods.</p>

    <p>Not: collect literally all of it you can.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Why people miss the point so often? I don’t know the answer. I used the middle one as an example of [[Goodhart’s Law]], that might be a reason.</p>
