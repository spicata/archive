    <p>You don’t argue for vanity. You don’t do it for some external third-party. You argue for yourself (see also [[Good Communication]]). So, well… don’t argue like you are arguing for a third party. Don’t feel pressured by others to come to an agreement. You know the purpose, and so, follow that.</p>
