    <p>Catalysts are substances that act as a reaction pathway. That’s not a very useful definition. A catalyst makes a reaction easier (this also happens to make it faster (see [[Rate of Reaction]]) ). It’s reusable, which is always nice.</p>

<p>How does a catalyst make a reaction easier? Well, it lowers the [[Activation Energy]] required to actually undergo a reaction. How does it do this?</p>

<p>Catalysts are a one-stop-shop for electron sharing. It’s a friendship bank.</p>

<p>![[Catalyst.png]]</p>

<p>Step 1, deposit your electron. You give your electron to the friendship bank. Step 2, while waiting for the electron to process, you wander around the bank and make a friend. Step 3, you withdraw you electron from the bank along with your friend, sharing it.</p>

<p>Enzymes are body catalysts. Substrates are body reactants. You need them to live.</p>
