    <p>If the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] holds, then the energy in our universe will always stay the same. So what? Well, that’s where the second law comes in. Any system will always tend towards [[Entropy]]. The distribution of energy will become pretty much equal.</p>

<p>Oh no! The universe is going to become a stale graveyard of nothingness. Well, I mean, yes. But it’ll take [[1point7e106]] years,</p>

<p>This brings up another thing. Only [[Easy Things Happen]]. Same goes here. If there’s a way to increase entropy, it’ll happen spontaneously. And, you know. It doesn’t expend too much energy.</p>
