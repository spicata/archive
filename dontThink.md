you know the saying *"think smarter not harder"*. well there's something even better. get so good at something so that **it becomes instinct**, so you **don't think at all**. take what pranav said (see [unmotivational quotes](quotes)), and simply make it natural so you don't think.

*proposal*: practice, practice, practice again, until something becomes second nature.
