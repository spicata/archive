    <p>Hey you. You might be going around reading my articles, thinking things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wow this guy really doesn’t know a thing about the world. I bet I could show him up.”<br />
- stock person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do think something like that, then feel free to! Send me your ideas at <a href="mailto:pixelandian@gmail.com">pixelandian@gmail.com</a> (or <a href="mailto:spicata@99000000.xyz">spicata@99000000.xyz</a> if you want to be novel, it leads to the same inbox anyways). On the other hand, if you happen to have a website, like the other Town Members, then why not just upload your response onto your website? I want to see what you guys think, and I want to know where you think I am wrong.</p>

<p>Think of it kind of like a digital and public pen-pal system I guess. I write articles, you send me articles in response.</p>
