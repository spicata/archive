As you may already know, your handwriting is fricking terrible. At the moment, only like half the words are actually legible. During the hlidays,  want to learn how to make them more readable. Preferablly by using cursive, because that'll probably be the smallest change that I can make while also making it readable.

- [ ] Watch videos on fixing handwriting/writing well/writing cursive
- [ ] You know, actually practice?

Along with that, I do have that sort of pressing and rather important Chinese Oral assessment, and so I should probably get a move on on that.

- [ ] Convert all the little notes and bulletpoints into better sentences (write them on paper)
- [ ] Get all pre-existing sentences and add in conjunctions
- [ ] Put them on the computer
- [ ] Begin by memorising the **last few**

Also, my [kanban board](kanban) is kind of full at the moment, and I should probably work to clear it. The main problem is the overwhelming amount of mathematics that is in it:

- [ ] Finish chapter 18 method (differentiation and things)
    - [ ] 18D
    - [ ] 18E
    - [ ] 18F
    - [ ] 18G
- [x] Finish chapter 12 spec (transformation matrix)
    - [x] 12E
    - [x] 12F
    - [x] 12G

I think we are in fact starting Samuel Wagon Watson next term, so I should probably...

- [ ] ... start reading that book.
- [ ] Write stuff (on the website) about some of the passages that you particularly enjoy

Oh yeah, on the topic of preparing in advance, the chemistry hydrocarbon things. Well, I won't say I have the fondest memories of them, but I am quite curious on them, so I guess I'll look at it too.

- [ ] At least finish Lucarelli 20 and 21 (pretty sure they are about hydrocarbons)
- [ ] Whip up some quick notes if you want

Also, I do in fact want to do some art, so uh...

- [ ] Figure out what the hell I'm doing and add it here.

I know that this is not a great deal, and probably not a comprehensive list of what I really do want to do, but it does kind of give me a direction to go.
