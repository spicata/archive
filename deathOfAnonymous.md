**anonymity on the internet is dying**. for example, when you make a gmail account, you can verify your age using a credit card or your **IN LIFE REAL ID**. which uh... seems risky considering google's track record. so uh... anonymity is on the fall and selling our data is on the rise. nice! ;-).

*proposal:* again, i dunno.

also, people are not being educated about staying safe on the web. we don't need policies and things and stuff if people didn't do dumb stuff. so here is your guide to staying safe on the internet:

- don't use your real name unless it's like for a business or something
- don't use your photo in public
- don't post your "hot takes" on the internet if you are using your real name and photo
- don't be a child. at least pretend to be an adult if you are a child
- don't post your addresss
- don't post literally any other sensitive information
- when possible, use fake personal information
