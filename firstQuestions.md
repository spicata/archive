if you want to change something, donate something, buy something, ask why the problem exists in the first place. to use an example i saw on the infinite net, before donating to save children in africa from an african child crusher, ask WHY THE HELL IS THERE AN AFRICAN CHILD CRUSHER IN AFRICA? it's pretty simple stuff. it might help you to find a better solution. for example, i wanted to get keyboard that i can pair to two devices so that i could easily change between them to lower time loss. i use the other computer only for discord. why do i have discord?
