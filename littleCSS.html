    <p>just a <strong>little bit of css goes a long way</strong>. there is <strong>no need for you to overuse</strong> css. for example, the css used to style this website is only 194 bytes in size. and it’s readable, and looks decent, so it’s fine. For reference, ed’s css (cause i like comparing) is 35,8 kibibytes, which is 36 659 bytes. that takes up <strong>189 times</strong> the quantity of storage than mine.</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: try to use the <strong>smallest amount of css possible</strong>.</p>
