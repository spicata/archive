    <p>you heard it right. i am <em>planning</em> on adding more layouts to my websites. most will just be a simple palette swaps etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>mint 🌱 - the default theme. it’s just for all thing. everything. slightly green</li>
  <li><a href="sakuraTest">sakura</a> 🌸 - its for pretty stuff. might use serif for this one. it’s for my guy fred :-). it’s pink</li>
  <li><a href="berryTest">berry</a> 🫐 - it’s for actually serious stuff. or responses to ed, because this is for him. it’s blue.</li>
  <li>rice 🌾 - slightly brown/goldish, this is for grown stuff. things that make sense. it’s wisened. it’s a result of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>i might not actually use the meanings.</p>
