    <p>we live in an increasingly connected world, and with that comes better communication, but this raises the question: <strong>is all communication that is fast communication that is worth it</strong>? i would beg to differ. and even if it is important, the rush of our communication leads to <strong>half-thought out responses</strong> and shallowness. so…</p>

<p><em>proposal</em>: try to send <strong>one email per person per day</strong>. email, specifically because it is slower and you can’t check if the other person has checked, so you are <strong>forced to sit on your thoughts</strong> for a while. and sending more than one is overkill. <strong>don’t treat email like messaging</strong>.</p>
