you heard it right. i am *planning* on adding more layouts to my websites. most will just be a simple palette swaps etc.

- mint 🌱 - the default theme. it's just for all thing. everything. slightly green
- [sakura](sakuraTest) 🌸 - its for pretty stuff. might use serif for this one. it's for my guy fred :-). it's pink
- [berry](berryTest) 🫐 - it's for actually serious stuff. or responses to ed, because this is for him. it's blue.
- rice 🌾 - slightly brown/goldish, this is for grown stuff. things that make sense. it's wisened. it's a result of work.

i might not actually use the meanings.
