    <p>When the Town first came out (i.e. when it was in itâ€™s infancy), it was a pretty novel idea, and it was interesting/exciting to be a part of it. Now that the Town has been here for a while, the novelty charm has gone away, and it seems illogical to put in so much time into maintaining this website that not many people see.</p>

<p>The ambition that we had at the start has quickly worn away, and we are now grounded in reality, and it makes it a little harder to actually get invested in it.</p>

<p>If only something could bring another edge of novelty to the Town.</p>
