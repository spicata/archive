> But there is an issue. In some cases, people can form what I’m going to describe as a “parasitical” relationship to these good things. They crave and crave for more of these good things. They moan incessantly about wanting more and more, and it spirals into an addiction of sorts. At this point, the original ‘goodness’ of this thing diminishes, and it hurts both the giver and the receiver.

Edward, if you are so easily pushed to writing an angry letter about me just because I said that I was eagerily awaiting Choyu's Taj lore because no-one else in the Town was writing anything, well uh, don't be such a fragile man. Just say 'no', and don't hide behind this wall of 'knowledge', or just make writings. It is not very hard.

Oh, by the way, at least I'm not the grand dictator of the Town. Talk about having an addiction to power (and also meth (on second though, definitely the meth)).
