    <p>a lot of smart people make really cool website about stuff like how we should adopt the principles of the old web (cough cough neocities) or like how we should try to construct a better internet. that’s cool and all… it’s just that…</p>

<p><img src="assets/loadTimes.png" alt="loadTimes" /></p>

<p>what the duck. if you are going to talk about making a better web, please make your website run well. now i’m not sure if this is a problem for you, but i live in a first world country with third world internet. what kind of things are you running in the background to warrant such a long load time? are we simulating old web load times?</p>
