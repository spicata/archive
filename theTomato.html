    <p>the tomato method<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, also known in spanish as the pomodoro method<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is a method of doing work where you give yourself exactly 25 minutes to work. it’s something you can <a href="beatTheTimer">beat the timer</a> with. now, the magic of the tomato is that… you have 25 minutes to finish whatever the crap you are doing. it pushes you to work faster. it’s also a good measure of time. sometimes things take 1 tomato to finish, other times it takes 2. preferably, don’t take more than 2 tomatoes to finish a task.</p>

<p>also it keeps you in check. don’t get carried away doing study.</p>
