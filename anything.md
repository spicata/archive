i believe that, if i put my mind to it, i can and will achieve anything. it's a self-delusion that seems to work. the only problem is finding something to do, and also starting. its always the hardest to get the snowball rolling, but its easy to go from there, because each action reveals to you other actions that you can do to follow it up.
