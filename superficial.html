    <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
    

    <p>Unless you are practising, exploring, or prospective, more depth tends to better than more quantity. The same should apply for the Town. We should probably focus on the quality of each website and the content on it, than trying to expand our boundaries and inviting new members in order to destabilise the political headlock. However, this is not what is currently going on within the Town.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the Town is <a href="lull">no longer a hotbed of ideas made by people</a>, and instead is just a conversational group of sorts. While this is good, conversations tend to be much more shallow and reactive than writing. This not only removed the depth of the Town, but also removed the personal nature of the websites.</p>

<p>So, we have shallowness in not only the content of the Town, but also the personal and emotional factor of it. As a group, we seem to have moved away from growth and instead embraced expansion, and we have spread ourselves thin.</p>
