## Jekyll and Hyde

### Binary Opposition

Steveson distorts binary opposition --- the juxtaposition of good and bad, moral and immoral, rational and emotional --- by using both to characterise the character of Dr Jekyll, and his counterpart, Mr Hyde. In doing so, Stevenson represents the Victorian way of thinking in these 'black and white' terms as a flawed method of thinking; one that does not function to depict the world in actuality.

### Private vs Public

As an extension of the binary opposition, during Victorian eras, there were clear distinctions between the public and private sphere of life. This fact is supported by the not only the characters in the text, but also of the settings they preside in. Dr Jekyll's manor has two fronts. One a luxourious manor, fit for a doctor of his influence. The other, a decrepict broken-down face, sporting only a few windows and a door. The house that Dr Jekyll lives in mirrors his inner plight; seperated between the vastly contrasting lives of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The more presentable side, Jekyll uses as his public image. The front of his manor and Dr Jekyll's persona, as this would maintain the status quo, whereas he hides, almost in shame, Mr Hyde, as it would lead to the deterioration of his good public image. It is eventually this rigorous maintanence of the separation of his public and his private lives that end up undoing Dr Jekyll, and in writing so, Steveson represents his attitude towards this separation of the two sectors of Victorian life; one of contempt and disillusionment.

### Dual Brain Theory

Hyde and Jekyll can also be analysed in referenced to dual brain theory. This theory supposes that the two hemispheres of the brain --- right and left --- are able to operatre independetly of each other, and that madness is caused by an imbalanced between the two. In this theory, the right hemisphere of the brain is often characterised with creativity, but also an emotional, irrational nature; backwards and primitive in its development. Contrastingly, the left hemisphere, is responsible for rational and civilised behaviours. Hyde's criminal and almost caveman-ish nature originates from the recesses of the right brain, as seen when he "borders on hysteria". Hysteria, being the outburst of strong emotion, is characteristic of the right brain, and his "troglodytic" nature comes as a result from the underdeveloped and uneducated nature of the right-hemisphere. His counterpart, Jekyll, is the "very pink of all properities", and seeing as he is a doctor by profession, can be seen a well-educated and morally upstanding member of society; akin to the left hemisphere. When understood like this, the inner conflict between Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde can be analysed as a struggle that is not only limited to Jekyll, but also the rest of humanity.

- "troglodytic"
- "approaches of the hysteria"

### Psychoanalysis

Again, the characterisation of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde can be understood through a Freudian psychonalaytical lens, specifically in terms of repression, as well as superego, ego, and id. In Freud's works, the dominion human psyche is split into three separate 'entities', that being superego, ego, and id. Id can be described as the most basic desires of humanity, the ones that would have been needed in order to survive in the wilderness: hunger, thirst, 'reproduction', and safety. Due to the role of Id, it is impulsive and selfish, thinking in terms of whatever benefits it most, much like Hyde. Hyde, having split from Jekyll's identity, is free to do as he pleases within the boundaries of his control, and in doing so, acts on impulse rather than thought, beating Sir Carew and trampling him in a fit of rage.

The unrestrained Id bring chaos into Dr Jekyll's life, who --- if Mr Hyde is id --- would be most accurately described as ego, being the mediator between Id and Superego. However, Jekyll post-potion is not exclusively ruled by ego, but is also in some parts superego, as he shows continues to show sympathy, and attempts to beter the society after the harm that Hyde has caused. In analysing the character of Hyde through the application Freudian theory, we are able to create the meaning that the loosening of the control on Id, and the diminishing of ego's powers, will tip the scales within the human psyche towards self-annihilation, and the case of Dr Jekyll can be read as a cautionary tale of not only indulging too much into one's pleasures, but also a warning against meddling with the human 'soul'.

## Hedda Gabler

### Marxist/Classist

The relationships formed within the play *Hedda Gabler* can be analysed through the differences in class betweent the characters. Primarily, there is the relationship between Jorgen Tesman and Hedda Tesman/Gabler. This marriage is a particular one: Jorgen originates from the low or middle-class, taken care by her two unmarried aunts after being orphaned. Hedda, on the other hand, comes from an wealthy aristocratic family, her late father being a Norweign general. The difference in their upbringing, as well as their class, shapes the relationship between these two character. Despite being married, they share little similiarites, and Hedda seems to think of herself as greater than Jorgen, and in uninterested in deeply rooting herself within the Tesman family, who she seems to be below her. On the other side, Jorgen deeply reveres Hedda, seeing her more as this idol, possibly as a result of her upper-class origin. Their difference in class not only shapes the way that they interact with each other, but also with other characters.

- "never once dreamed they'd make a match of it"

### Value: autonomy

Throughout the play, Hedda seeks out autonomy --- which not only reflects the feminist movement that was beginning to spark in the Western world at the time of production, but also represents autonomy as a universally sought after freedom. eh.

- "our child"

### Context

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

So anyways,

In late 19th century Norway, the roles for both men and women were well defined, and by modern standards, can be seen as limiting. Women were (traditionally) limited to the domestic sphere; there were seen as housekeepers and caretakers, and their priority was to take care of their family. It was these societal expectations that prevented Hedda's attempts at freedom and self-autonomy. In doing this, Ibsen represents these expectations as a burden on society.

- "horribly tedious"
