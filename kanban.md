the kanban board is (oh so) great. it has pulled me out of a rut of unproductivity and it actually gets things done.

so essentially, a kanban board is 3 lists. a to do list, a doing list, and a done list. if there is something in your doing list, make it done. if there is something in your to do list, start doing it. this little system makes it quite a bit easier to actually manage the tasks that you are doing, and it genuinely helps a lot.
