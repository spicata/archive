just a **little bit of css goes a long way**. there is **no need for you to overuse** css. for example, the css used to style this website is only 194 bytes in size. and it's readable, and looks decent, so it's fine. For reference, ed's css (cause i like comparing) is 35,8 kibibytes, which is 36 659 bytes. that takes up **189 times** the quantity of storage than mine.

*proposal*: try to use the **smallest amount of css possible**.
