When the Town first came out (i.e. when it was in it's infancy), it was a pretty novel idea, and it was interesting/exciting to be a part of it. Now that the Town has been here for a while, the novelty charm has gone away, and it seems illogical to put in so much time into maintaining this website that not many people see.

The ambition that we had at the start has quickly worn away, and we are now grounded in reality, and it makes it a little harder to actually get invested in it.

If only something could bring another edge of novelty to the Town.
